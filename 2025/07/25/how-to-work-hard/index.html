<p>June 2021 </p>
<p>It might not seem there’s much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who’s been to school knows what it entails, even if they chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I was in school, the answer is definitely yes. </p>
<p>关于如何努力工作，似乎没什么太多可学的。任何上过学的人都知道努力工作意味着什么，即便他们选择不这么做。有些 12 岁的孩子就已经非常努力了。但如果问我现在对努力工作的理解是否比上学时更深，答案无疑是肯定的。</p>
<p>One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you’ll have to work very hard. I wasn’t sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork varied in difficulty; one didn’t always have to work super hard to do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question. There isn’t. </p>
<p>我知道的一点是，若想成就伟大的事业，就必须付出极大的努力。小时候我对此并不确定。学校的功课难度不一，有时不必拼尽全力也能做得很好。而且有些知名人士的成就，看似毫不费力就能达成。或许，仅凭过人的天赋就能规避努力工作的必要？如今我有了答案：不能。</p>
<p>The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy. </p>
<p>有些科目看似简单，是因为我所在的学校标准太低。而那些知名人士看似轻松的成就，背后是多年的练习 —— 他们只是让一切看起来毫不费力。</p>
<p>Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard. [1] </p>
<p>当然，这些知名人士通常也极具天赋。伟大的成就由三个要素构成：天赋、练习和努力。具备其中两项就能做得不错，但要做到顶尖，三者缺一不可：你需要极高的天赋、大量的练习，以及全力以赴的努力。[1]</p>
<p>Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. “I never took a day off in my twenties,” he said. “Not one.” It was similar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one’s toes and makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases twenty times. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>比如比尔・盖茨，他是自己时代商界最聪明的人之一，但也是最努力的人之一。他曾说：“我二十多岁时一天都没休息过，一天都没有。” 莱昂内尔・梅西也是如此。他天赋异禀，但青年时期的教练们回忆起他时，印象最深的不是他的天赋，而是他的专注和求胜欲。如果要我选 20 世纪最优秀的英语作家，P.G. 伍德豪斯或许会是我的答案。没人比他更能让写作看起来轻松，但也没人比他更努力。74 岁时，他写道：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“就像我说的，每写一本新书，我都觉得自己像是在文学的花园里摘了个柠檬。不过或许这是件好事，能让我时刻保持警觉，把每句话改写十遍，很多时候甚至二十遍。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even more extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had about as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both. </p>
<p>你可能觉得这有点极端，但比尔・盖茨的经历更极端。十年间一天都不休息？这两个人拥有常人难以企及的天赋，却也付出了常人难以想象的努力。两者你都需要。</p>
<p>That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard to grasp. There’s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less of the other. But you’ll need both if you want to be an outlier yourself. And since you can’t really change how much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces to working very hard. </p>
<p>这道理看似显而易见，但实践中我们却很难完全理解。人们似乎总觉得天赋和努力是 “非此即彼” 的。这种想法部分源于流行文化（其影响根深蒂固），部分源于 “异类” 本身极为罕见。如果极高的天赋和极强的驱动力都很稀有，那么两者兼具的人就更稀有了。你遇到的大多数人，往往在一方面突出，在另一方面就稍显不足。但如果你想成为 “异类”，就必须两者兼具。既然天赋难以改变，那么在实践中，成就伟大的事业（尽你所能）就归结为付出极大的努力。</p>
<p>It’s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate (which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want it. </p>
<p>如果目标明确且由外部设定（比如上学时），努力工作就很直接。这需要一些技巧：学会不欺骗自己，不拖延（拖延是欺骗自己的一种形式），不分心，遇到问题不放弃。但只要愿意，即便是小孩子也能达到这种自律水平。</p>
<p>What I’ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You’ll probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things. </p>
<p>长大后我才明白，如何为那些既不明确也非外部设定的目标努力。若想成就真正伟大的事业，这两种努力方式你可能都得学会。</p>
<p>The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I’m not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can’t be sure I’m getting anywhere when I’m working hard, but I can be sure I’m getting nowhere when I’m not, and it feels awful. [2] </p>
<p>最基础的是，即便没人督促，你也能意识到自己应该工作。现在，如果我没在努力工作，警钟就会敲响。我不确定努力时是否一定有进展，但我确定不努力时一定毫无进展，这种感觉糟透了。[2]</p>
<p>There wasn’t a single point when I learned this. Like most little kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of disgust when I wasn’t achieving anything. The one precisely dateable landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13. </p>
<p>我并非在某个瞬间领悟到这一点。和大多数孩子一样，我小时候学到新东西或做成事时，会享受成就感。长大后，这种感觉渐渐变成了 “一事无成时的厌恶”。我能明确追溯的一个节点是 13 岁那年，我不再看电视了。</p>
<p>Several people I’ve talked to remember getting serious about work around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to find idleness distasteful, he said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense. </p>
<p>我聊过的几个人都记得，大概在这个年纪开始认真对待工作。当我问帕特里克・科里森何时开始厌恶懒散时，他说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“大概 13 或 14 岁吧。我清楚记得，当时坐在客厅里，望着窗外，纳闷自己为什么在浪费暑假。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>或许青春期会发生一些变化，这似乎说得通。</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about work was probably school, which made work (what they called work) seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire departments that are pointless. </p>
<p>奇怪的是，认真对待工作的最大障碍或许是学校 —— 学校让 “工作”（他们所谓的工作）显得枯燥又无意义。我必须先明白什么是 “真正的工作”，才能全身心投入。这花了些时间，因为即便是在大学里，很多工作也是无意义的；有些院系甚至完全是摆设。</p>
<p>But as I learned the shape of real work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they’d been made for each other. I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can love it. </p>
<p>但当我逐渐了解了真正工作的模样后，我发现自己对工作的渴望与它完美契合，仿佛二者本就为彼此而生。我猜想，大多数人都得先弄明白工作究竟是什么，才可能爱上它。</p>
<p>Hardy wrote eloquently about this in A Mathematician’s Apology: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He didn’t learn what math was really about till part way through college, when he read Jordan’s Cours d’analyse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>哈代在《一个数学家的辩白》中精辟地描述过这一点：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“我记得小时候，对数学毫无热情，对数学家的职业想象也毫无崇高感。我只把数学和考试、奖学金联系在一起：我想打败其他男孩，而数学似乎是最有效的方式。” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>他直到大学期间读了若尔当的《分析教程》，才明白数学的真谛：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“我永远忘不了读那本杰作时的震撼 —— 那是我第一次明白数学真正的意义，这本书也是我们这一代许多数学家的启蒙。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to discount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind Hardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they’re adapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they’re nothing like the work done by actual practitioners. [3] </p>
<p>要理解 “真正的工作”，你需要学会忽略两种 “虚假”。一种是哈代在学校遇到的：学科为了适应教学被扭曲，往往扭曲到和从业者的实际工作毫无关系。[3] </p>
<p>The other kind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types of work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork. </p>
<p>另一种是某些工作本身固有的虚假 —— 有些工作本质上就是无意义的，顶多算是 “瞎忙”。</p>
<p>There’s a kind of solidity to real work. It’s not all writing the Principia, but it all feels necessary. That’s a vague criterion, but it’s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of different types. [4] </p>
<p>真正的工作有一种 “实在感”。并非都像写《自然哲学的数学原理》那样伟大，但都让人觉得 “有必要”。这个标准很模糊，但故意如此，因为它要涵盖太多不同类型的工作。[4]</p>
<p>Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many hours a day to spend on it. You can’t solve this problem by simply working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there’s a point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline. </p>
<p>明白真正的工作是什么样之后，你需要知道每天该花多少时间在上面。不能醒着就一直工作，因为很多工作超过某个临界点后，质量就会下降。</p>
<p>That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person. I’ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits were different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running a startup, I could work all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I’d kept going much longer, I’d probably have needed to take occasional vacations. [5] </p>
<p>这个临界点因工作类型和个人而异。我做过几种不同的工作，每种的临界点都不同。较难的写作或编程，我一天最多能做 5 小时。而运营初创公司时，我可以一直工作 —— 至少在那三年里是这样；如果再做更久，可能就得偶尔休假了。[5]</p>
<p>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a sensitivity to the quality of the work you’re doing, and then you’ll notice if it decreases because you’re working too hard. Honesty is critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you’re being lazy, but also when you’re working too hard. And if you think there’s something admirable about working too hard, get that idea out of your head. You’re not merely getting worse results, but getting them because you’re showing off — if not to other people, then to yourself. [6] </p>
<p>找到临界点的唯一方法是 “越过它”。培养对工作质量的敏感度，你就会注意到是否因过度工作而导致质量下降。诚实在这里至关重要：既要察觉自己是否懒散，也要发现是否工作过度。如果你觉得过度工作很 “可敬”，赶紧丢掉这个想法。你不仅会得到更差的结果，还会因为 “炫耀”（哪怕只是向自己炫耀）而搞砸工作。[6]</p>
<p>Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process, not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be constantly judging both how hard you’re trying and how well you’re doing. </p>
<p>找到努力工作的临界点是一个持续的过程，而非一劳永逸。工作难度和你的能力每时每刻都在变化，所以你需要不断判断自己的努力程度和工作状态。</p>
<p>Trying hard doesn’t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though. There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly typical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I’m starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That’s when I’m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I tend to keep going. </p>
<p>不过，努力不意味着一直强迫自己工作。或许有人这样做，但我的经历可能更典型：只有在启动项目或遇到阻碍时，才需要偶尔逼自己一把 —— 这时候最容易拖延。但一旦进入状态，就会自然而然地继续下去。</p>
<p>What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working on Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated at all then, because there was always something that needed doing, and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast by doing it, why wait? [7] Whereas what drives me now, writing essays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days, like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But once I get started on one, I don’t have to push myself to work, because there’s always some error or omission already pushing me. </p>
<p>支撑我坚持的动力因工作类型而异。运营 Viaweb 时，我被 “失败的恐惧” 驱动：总有事情要做，多做一点就能离失败远一点，何必等呢？[7] 而现在写文章，动力来自 “文章的缺陷”：构思期间我会纠结几天，像狗转圈选窝一样。但一旦开始写，就不用逼自己 —— 总有错误或疏漏在推着我前进。</p>
<p>I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff at the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the extent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you’ll only be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should always be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling. </p>
<p>我确实会努力聚焦于重要的话题。很多问题的核心很难，周围是容易的边缘内容。努力工作意味着尽可能瞄准核心。有些日子可能做不到，只能处理边缘内容，但你应该始终朝着核心努力。</p>
<p>The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at the edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in working on a specific problem, you’ll occasionally have to make big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do. And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the center — toward the most ambitious problems. </p>
<p>“人生该做什么” 这个更大的问题，也有这样的 “核心”：中心是重要但困难的问题，边缘是次要且容易的。所以除了日常调整具体工作，你偶尔还需要做人生层面的重大调整：选择哪种工作。原则不变：努力工作意味着瞄准核心 —— 最有野心的问题。</p>
<p>By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current consensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are most important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific fields. If you disagree with it, and you’re right, that could represent a valuable opportunity to do something new. </p>
<p>不过，“核心” 指的是 “真正的核心”，而非当前共识中的 “核心”。关于 “哪些问题最重要”，共识往往是错的，无论是在整体还是特定领域。如果你不同意共识且正确，那可能是个做新事的好机会。</p>
<p>The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you discover some ambitious type of work that’s a bargain in the sense of being easier for you than other people, either because of the abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you’ve found to approach it, or simply because you’re more excited about it, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by people who find an easy way to do something hard. </p>
<p>更有野心的工作通常更难，但不必因此却步。如果你发现某种有野心的工作对你来说更容易 —— 因为你的天赋、新方法，或者仅仅是更感兴趣 —— 那就去做。有些最伟大的成就是由 “找到难事的简单解法” 的人完成的。</p>
<p>As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out which kind you’re suited for. And that doesn’t just mean figuring out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn’t mean that if you’re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What you’re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even more on your interests. A deep interest in a topic makes people work harder than any amount of discipline can. </p>
<p>除了理解真正的工作是什么样，你还需要找到适合自己的类型。这不只是看天赋匹配 —— 比如身高 7 英尺未必就得打篮球。适合与否不仅取决于天赋，更可能取决于兴趣。对一个领域的浓厚兴趣，能让人比任何纪律都更努力。</p>
<p>It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents. There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a subtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later. The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful sources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really interested in x, or do you want to work on it because you’ll make a lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you, or because your parents want you to? [8] </p>
<p>发现兴趣比发现天赋更难。天赋的类型更少，从小就被评判；而对一个领域的兴趣很微妙，可能二十多岁甚至更晚才成熟，甚至这个领域之前都不存在。此外，你需要排除一些干扰：你真的对 X 感兴趣，还是因为能赚大钱、让人佩服，或者父母希望你做？[8]</p>
<p>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That’s one of the most important things I’ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That’s how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard. </p>
<p>“找到该做什么” 的难度因人而异，这是我长大后对工作最重要的领悟之一。小时候，我觉得每个人都有 “使命”，只需找到它就行 —— 电影和给孩子看的简化传记都这么说。现实中有时确实如此：有些人小时候就确定方向并坚持，比如莫扎特。但另一些人，比如牛顿，会不安地从一种工作转向另一种。或许回头看我们能认定他的 “使命”（希望他多花时间在数学和物理上，少在炼金术和神学上），但这是后见之明的错觉 —— 他从未听到过所谓的 “召唤”。</p>
<p>So while some people’s lives converge fast, there will be others whose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what to work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing part of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these people, the process I described earlier has a third component: along with measuring both how hard you’re working and how well you’re doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in this field or switch to another. If you’re working hard but not getting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple expressed that way, but in practice it’s very difficult. You shouldn’t give up on the first day just because you work hard and don’t get anywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much time? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going well? How much time do you give yourself then? [9] </p>
<p>所以，有些人的人生很快聚焦，有些人则永远不会。对后者来说，“找到该做什么” 不是努力工作的前奏，而是其一部分，就像一组联立方程。这些人需要不断判断：既要衡量努力程度和成果，也要思考是否该换个领域。如果努力了却没好结果，就该换。说起来简单，做起来很难：不能第一天没进展就放弃，需要给时间让自己进入状态。但给多久？如果曾经顺利的工作突然停滞，又该给多久？[9]</p>
<p>What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide. If you’re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not even know what good results look like. History is full of examples of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working on. </p>
<p>“什么算好结果” 也很难判断。如果在很少人涉足的领域探索，你可能都不知道好结果是什么样。历史上很多人都误判了自己工作的重要性。</p>
<p>The best test of whether it’s worthwhile to work on something is whether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously subjective measure, but it’s probably the most accurate one you’re going to get. You’re the one working on the stuff. Who’s in a better position than you to judge whether it’s important, and what’s a better predictor of its importance than whether it’s interesting? </p>
<p>判断一件事是否值得做，最好的标准是 “你是否觉得它有趣”。这听起来主观，但可能是最准确的。你是做这件事的人，谁比你更适合判断它是否重要？而 “有趣” 往往是 “重要” 的最佳预示。</p>
<p>For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself. Indeed, that’s the most striking thing about the whole question of working hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with yourself. </p>
<p>但这需要你对自己诚实。事实上，努力工作的整个问题中，最突出的一点就是：每一步都取决于对自己诚实。</p>
<p>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It’s a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you’re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you’re capable of and how you’re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you’re consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you’ll be productive in a way few people are.      </p>
<p>努力工作不是把 “旋钮” 拧到最大。它是一个复杂的动态系统，需要随时调整：你要理解真正的工作是什么样，看清自己最适合哪种，尽可能瞄准其核心，时刻判断自己的能力和状态，每天投入不影响质量的时间。这个系统太复杂，无法欺骗。但如果你始终诚实、清醒，它自然会达到最佳状态，让你拥有少数人才能达到的生产力。</p>
<p>Notes </p>
<p>[1] In “The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius” I said the three ingredients in great work were natural ability, determination, and interest. That’s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest yield practice and effort. </p>
<p>[1] 在《天才的公交车票理论》中，我说过伟大工作的三个要素是天赋、决心和兴趣。这是前期的公式；决心和兴趣会转化为练习和努力。</p>
<p>[2] I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You’ll often get somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to a problem comes to you while taking a shower, or even in your sleep, but only because you were working hard on it the day before. It’s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation, I like to learn new things. I wouldn’t like just sitting on a beach. </p>
<p>[2] 我说的是按 “天” 来衡量，而非 “小时”。你常常会在 “不工作” 时有所进展 —— 比如洗澡时甚至睡梦中想到问题的解决方案，但这只是因为前一天你在这件事上付出了努力。偶尔度假是好的，但我度假时喜欢学新东西。我不喜欢只是坐在沙滩上。</p>
<p>[3] The thing kids do in school that’s most like the real version is sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played in schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly what adults do. In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending to do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend. Arguably the latter is no worse. </p>
<p>[3] 孩子们在学校做的事情中，最接近 “真实版本” 的是体育运动。诚然，很多运动起源于学校里的游戏。但至少在这一领域，孩子们做的和成年人完全一样。在普通的美国高中，你可以选择 “假装做正经事”，或者 “认真做假事”。可以说，后者并不比前者差。</p>
<p>[4] Knowing what you want to work on doesn’t mean you’ll be able to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things they don’t want to, especially early on. But if you know what you want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in. </p>
<p>[4] 知道自己想做什么工作，不代表就能去做。大多数人不得不花大量时间做自己不想做的事，尤其是在早期。但如果你知道自己想做什么，至少知道该把人生推向哪个方向。</p>
<p>[5] The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to the problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch to harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately. </p>
<p>[5] 高强度工作的时间限制较低，这为 “有孩子后工作时间减少” 的问题提供了一个解决方案：转向更难的问题。实际上我就是这么做的，尽管并非刻意。</p>
<p>[6] Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I don’t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something important and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing things that don’t matter. I don’t know enough to say for sure whether it’s net good or bad, but my guess is bad. </p>
<p>[6] 有些文化有 “表演式努力” 的传统。我不喜欢这个想法，因为（a）它把重要的事情变成了滑稽模仿；（b）它让人们在无意义的事情上耗尽精力。我了解得不够多，无法确定其整体是好是坏，但我猜是坏的。</p>
<p>[7] One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that startups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both decisive and conspicuous. </p>
<p>[7] 人们在初创公司如此努力的原因之一是：初创公司可能失败，而失败往往是决定性且显眼的。</p>
<p>[8] It’s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need to solve the money problem somehow, and there’s nothing wrong with doing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose it would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake; whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you’re conscious of your motivations. The thing to avoid is unconsciously letting the need for money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most interesting. </p>
<p>[8] 为了赚大钱而工作是没问题的。你总得解决钱的问题，通过努力一次性多赚点来高效解决，这没什么不对。我甚至觉得，为了钱本身而对钱感兴趣也没问题 —— 只要是你喜欢的就好。关键是要清楚自己的动机。要避免的是：无意识地让对钱的需求扭曲你对 “自己最感兴趣的工作” 的判断。</p>
<p>[9] Many people face this question on a smaller scale with individual projects. But it’s easier both to recognize and to accept a dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work entirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a Spanish Flu victim, you’re fighting your own immune system: Instead of giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who can say you’re not right?</p>
<p>[9] 很多人在单个项目中也会遇到类似问题，只是规模更小。但承认某个项目走进死胡同，比彻底放弃某类工作要容易得多。你越有决心，就越难放弃。就像西班牙流感患者一样，你在和自己的免疫系统对抗：你告诉自己 “应该更努力”，而不是放弃。可谁又能说你不对呢？</p>
