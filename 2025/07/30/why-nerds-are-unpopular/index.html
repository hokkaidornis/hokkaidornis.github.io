<p>February 2003</p>
<p>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the kids with mild cases of Down’s Syndrome, what in the language of the time we called “retards.”</p>
<p>初中时，我和朋友里奇曾根据受欢迎程度给学校的午餐桌画了一张地图。这事儿不难，因为孩子们只和与自己受欢迎程度相近的人一起吃饭。我们把桌子从 A 到 E 分级：A 桌坐满了足球运动员、啦啦队员之类的人；E 桌则是那些患有轻度唐氏综合征的孩子，按当时的说法，我们叫他们 “傻子”。</p>
<p>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise. Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was, including us.</p>
<p>我们坐在 D 桌 —— 在外表和别人没差别的情况下，这已经是最低等级了。给自个儿评 D 并非过分坦诚，要说别的，那才是故意撒谎。全校每个人都清楚彼此的受欢迎程度，我们也不例外。</p>
<p>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived; I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground newspaper. So I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.</p>
<p>高中时，我的 “等级” 慢慢上升了：青春期终于到来，我成了还不错的足球选手，还办了一份引起轰动的地下报纸。所以，我对 “受欢迎” 这事儿的方方面面还算了解。</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular.</p>
<p>我认识很多上学时是书呆子的人，他们的经历如出一辙：聪明和书呆子气之间有很强的相关性，而书呆子气和受欢迎程度之间的负相关更强。似乎聪明就会让你不受欢迎。</p>
<p>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart doesn’t make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult. Why?</p>
<p>为什么？对现在还在上学的人来说，这问题可能有点奇怪。事实太明显了，以至于很难想象还有别的可能。但其实是有的：在小学，聪明不会让你成为异类；在现实世界，聪明也不会对你不利；而且据我所知，在其他大多数国家，这问题也没这么严重。但在典型的美国中学里，聪明很可能会让你的日子不好过。为什么？</p>
<p>The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why don’t smart kids make themselves popular? If they’re so smart, why don’t they figure out how popularity works and beat the system, just as they do for standardized tests?</p>
<p>解开这个谜团的关键，是把问题换个说法：为什么聪明的孩子不让自己变得受欢迎？既然他们这么聪明，为什么不像应对标准化考试那样，搞懂受欢迎的门道，然后 “玩转规则” 呢？</p>
<p>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart, and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that guys envy, girls like.</p>
<p>有一种说法是这不可能：聪明的孩子不受欢迎，是因为其他孩子嫉妒他们的聪明，所以无论他们做什么都没用。但愿如此吧。要是初中时其他孩子真嫉妒我，那他们可太会掩饰了。而且，要是聪明真的是值得羡慕的特质，女孩们早就该 “叛变” 了 —— 男孩们嫉妒的人，女孩们往往会喜欢。</p>
<p>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn’t matter much. Kids didn’t admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.</p>
<p>在我就读的学校里，聪明根本不算什么。孩子们既不崇拜，也不鄙视聪明。其他条件相同的话，他们或许更愿意做中等偏上的聪明人，而不是笨蛋，但智力的重要性远不及外貌、魅力或运动能力。</p>
<p>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that they don’t really want to be popular.</p>
<p>既然智力本身和受欢迎程度无关，那为什么聪明的孩子总是不受欢迎？我觉得答案是：他们其实并不想受欢迎。</p>
<p>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn’t want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of thirst in a desert that he didn’t want a glass of water. Of course I wanted to be popular.</p>
<p>要是当时有人这么跟我说，我肯定会笑他。在学校不受欢迎会让孩子痛苦，有些孩子甚至会因此自杀。说我不想受欢迎，就像对沙漠里快渴死的人说他不想要一杯水一样荒唐。我当然想受欢迎。</p>
<p>But in fact I didn’t, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things.</p>
<p>但事实是，我没那么想 —— 至少没那么强烈。我有更想追求的东西：变得聪明。这不只是在学校考个好成绩（虽然那也有点用），而是设计漂亮的火箭、写好文章，或是搞懂怎么编程。总的来说，是创造伟大的事物。</p>
<p>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn’t have taken it.</p>
<p>那时候我从没试着把自己的欲望分开权衡。要是权衡过，我就会发现 “变聪明” 更重要。要是有人说能让我成为全校最受欢迎的孩子，但条件是我的智力得降到平均水平（姑且这么假设），我是不会答应的。</p>
<p>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don’t think many nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn’t drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired by everyone?</p>
<p>尽管不受欢迎让书呆子们很难受，但我觉得大多数人都不会接受这个交易。对他们来说，“智力平平” 是无法忍受的。但大多数孩子会接受 —— 对一半的人来说，这都是进步。就算是智力排在前 20% 的人（按当时大家的理解，智力是单一维度的），谁不想用 30 分的智力换所有人的喜爱和崇拜呢？</p>
<p>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.</p>
<p>我想，这就是问题的根源。书呆子有两个 “主人”：他们当然想受欢迎，但更想变聪明。而在竞争激烈的美国中学里，受欢迎这事儿可没法在 “业余时间” 搞定。</p>
<p>Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that “no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.” I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>阿尔贝蒂 —— 可以说是文艺复兴时期 “全才” 的典范 —— 曾写道：“任何技艺，无论多微不足道，若想精通，都需全身心投入。” 我怀疑这世上有没有人比美国学生为了受欢迎更拼命。相比之下，海豹突击队队员和神经外科住院医生都像懒汉 —— 他们偶尔还能休假，有些人甚至有爱好。而美国青少年可能一年 365 天，醒着的每一刻都在为 “受欢迎” 努力。</p>
<p>I don’t mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers are always on duty as conformists.</p>
<p>我不是说他们是有意识地这么做。有些孩子确实像小马基雅维利，但我真正想表达的是：青少年时刻都在 “扮演” 合群的人。</p>
<p>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don’t consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good. But to who? To the other kids. Other kids’ opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they make to do things “right” is also, consciously or not, an effort to be more popular.</p>
<p>比如，青少年很在意穿着。他们不是故意穿得受欢迎，而是想穿得好看。但 “好看” 是给谁看的？给其他孩子看。其他孩子的看法成了他们判断 “正确” 的标准 —— 不仅是衣服，几乎所有事都如此，甚至包括走路的姿势。所以，他们为 “做好一件事” 付出的所有努力，无论有意识还是无意识，都是为了更受欢迎。</p>
<p>Nerds don’t realize this. They don’t realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field don’t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall. In fact, most people who “can draw” like drawing, and have spent many hours doing it; that’s why they’re good at it. Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.</p>
<p>书呆子没意识到这一点。他们没意识到 “受欢迎” 需要付出努力。一般来说，不在某个高要求领域的人，都意识不到成功需要持续（往往是无意识的）的努力。比如，大多数人觉得画画是一种天赋，就像长得高一样。但事实上，大多数 “会画画” 的人是因为喜欢画，花了很多时间练习，所以才擅长。同理，受欢迎不是 “是” 或 “不是” 的状态，而是需要自己去争取的。</p>
<p>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties. They’re like someone trying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.</p>
<p>书呆子不受欢迎的主要原因是：他们有其他事情要思考。他们的注意力在书本或自然世界上，而不是时尚和派对。这就像有人想一边踢足球，一边在头顶平衡一杯水。其他能全神贯注踢球的人会轻松击败他们，还会纳闷他们怎么这么笨。</p>
<p>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please.</p>
<p>就算书呆子和其他孩子一样在乎受欢迎，对他们来说，变受欢迎也要更费劲。受欢迎的孩子学会受欢迎、渴望受欢迎的方式，和书呆子学会变聪明、渴望变聪明的方式一样 —— 都是从父母那里学来的。当书呆子被训练着 “得出正确答案” 时，受欢迎的孩子正被训练着 “讨人喜欢”。</p>
<p>So far I’ve been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd, using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it’s only the context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn’t socially adept enough. But “enough” depends on where you are. In a typical American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least, so specific) that you don’t have to be especially awkward to look awkward by comparison.</p>
<p>到目前为止，我一直在模糊 “聪明” 和 “书呆子” 的关系，把它们当同义词用。但其实这取决于环境。书呆子是那些社交能力不够的人，但 “够不够” 要看具体场合。在典型的美国学校里，“酷” 的标准太高（或者说太特殊），所以哪怕你只是稍微有点笨拙，看起来也会很显眼。</p>
<p>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they’ll tend to become nerds. And that’s why smart people’s lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.</p>
<p>很少有聪明的孩子能分出足够的精力去追求受欢迎。除非他们碰巧长得好看、是天生的运动员，或是受欢迎孩子的兄弟姐妹，否则他们很可能会变成书呆子。这就是为什么聪明人在 11 到 17 岁左右的日子最难过 —— 这个年纪的生活，远比之前或之后更围绕 “受欢迎” 展开。</p>
<p>Before that, kids’ lives are dominated by their parents, not by other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school, but this isn’t their whole life, as it later becomes.</p>
<p>在这之前，孩子的生活由父母主导，而不是同龄人。小学时，孩子确实在乎同伴的看法，但这不是他们生活的全部，后来却成了全部。</p>
<p>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family. Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the world they care about.</p>
<p>但到了 11 岁左右，孩子们似乎开始把家庭当成 “日常任务”。他们在彼此之间创造了一个新世界，在这个世界里的地位才重要，而不是在家庭里的地位。事实上，在家庭里惹麻烦，甚至能在他们在乎的那个世界里加分。</p>
<p>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at first a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds to their own devices, what you get is Lord of the Flies. Like a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed entirely believable, I didn’t get the additional message. I wish they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world was stupid.</p>
<p>问题是，孩子们为自己创造的这个世界，一开始非常粗糙。要是让一群 11 岁的孩子自己待着，结果就会像《蝇王》里写的那样。和很多美国孩子一样，我在学校里读过这本书。这大概不是巧合 —— 大概有人想告诉我们，我们是野蛮人，我们创造了一个残酷又愚蠢的世界。但这对我来说太隐晦了。虽然书里的内容看起来完全可信，但我没 get 到那个深层信息。真希望他们直接告诉我们：我们是野蛮人，我们的世界很愚蠢。</p>
<p>Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted.</p>
<p>要是不受欢迎仅仅意味着被忽视，书呆子或许还能忍受。但不幸的是，在学校里不受欢迎，就意味着会被主动排挤。</p>
<p>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But they could be. Adults don’t normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage kids do it?</p>
<p>为什么？现在还在上学的人可能又会觉得这问题很奇怪 —— 事情难道还能是别的样子吗？但确实可以是别的样子。成年人一般不会排挤书呆子，为什么青少年会呢？</p>
<p>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing.</p>
<p>部分原因是，青少年还半是孩子，很多孩子天生就残忍。有些孩子折磨书呆子，就像他们扯掉蜘蛛的腿一样 —— 在良知形成之前，折磨是有趣的。</p>
<p>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I’ve read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.</p>
<p>另一个原因是，孩子们通过排挤书呆子来自我安慰。就像踩水时，你要把水往下推才能让自己浮起来。同理，在任何社会等级中，对自己地位不确定的人，会通过欺负他们认为等级更低的人来强调自己的地位。我读过相关内容，说这就是为什么美国的贫穷白人是对黑人最不友好的群体。</p>
<p>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it’s part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It’s much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.</p>
<p>但我觉得，其他孩子排挤书呆子的主要原因是：这是 “受欢迎机制” 的一部分。受欢迎不仅取决于个人魅力，更多取决于 “联盟”。要想更受欢迎，你得不断做些能让自己和其他受欢迎的人拉近距离的事，而没有什么比共同的敌人更能拉近人了。</p>
<p>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy if there isn’t a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.</p>
<p>就像政客想转移选民对国内困境的注意力一样，要是没有真正的敌人，你可以创造一个。通过孤立和排挤某个书呆子，一群等级更高的孩子能巩固彼此的关系。攻击外来者，能让他们都成为 “自己人”。这就是为什么最严重的欺凌往往是群体性的。问问任何一个书呆子就知道：一群孩子的欺负，比任何单个恶霸的虐待都要可怕，无论那个恶霸多残忍。</p>
<p>If it’s any consolation to the nerds, it’s nothing personal. The group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together to go hunting. They don’t actually hate you. They just need something to chase.</p>
<p>要是能给书呆子一点安慰的话，那就是：这不是针对个人。那些联合起来欺负你的孩子，和一群一起去打猎的人做的是同一件事，原因也一样 —— 他们不是真的恨你，只是需要个东西来追。</p>
<p>Because they’re at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don’t persecute nerds; they don’t need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.</p>
<p>因为书呆子处于等级的最底层，所以他们成了全校都能安全攻击的目标。我记得很清楚，最受欢迎的孩子不会排挤书呆子 —— 他们没必要降低身份做这种事。大多数排挤来自中间阶层的孩子，那些焦虑的 “中产”。</p>
<p>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want to pick on nerds than there are nerds.</p>
<p>麻烦的是，这种孩子太多了。受欢迎程度的分布不是金字塔，而是像梨一样，底部很尖。最不受欢迎的群体非常小（我记得我们的午餐桌地图里，D 桌只有我们）。所以，想欺负书呆子的人，比书呆子本身还多。</p>
<p>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.</p>
<p>除了通过疏远不受欢迎的人来加分，和他们走得近还会减分。我认识一个女人说，高中时她喜欢书呆子，但不敢让人看到她和他们说话，因为其他女孩会嘲笑她。不受欢迎是一种 “传染病”—— 就算是不忍心欺负书呆子的孩子，为了自保也会疏远他们。</p>
<p>It’s no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle school and high school. Their other interests leave them little attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the situation.</p>
<p>难怪聪明的孩子在初中和高中容易不开心。他们的其他兴趣让他们没精力去追求受欢迎，而由于受欢迎就像零和游戏，这反过来又让他们成了全校的目标。奇怪的是，这种噩梦般的场景并非源于刻意的恶意，只是由环境本身的结构造成的。</p>
<p>For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I’ve talked to agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.</p>
<p>对我来说，最糟糕的是初中时期 —— 那时候，“孩子文化” 刚形成，还很残酷，而后来能逐渐把聪明孩子分开的 “专业化” 才刚刚开始。几乎所有我聊过的人都同意：低谷在 11 到 14 岁之间。</p>
<p>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.</p>
<p>我们学校是八年级，那时我 12 到 13 岁。那年有件事引起了短暂的轰动：一位老师无意中听到一群女孩在等校车时的谈话，震惊之下，第二天整堂课都在慷慨陈词，呼吁她们不要对彼此那么残忍。</p>
<p>It didn’t have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn’t know the kind of things they say to one another? You mean this isn’t normal?</p>
<p>但这没什么明显效果。当时让我震惊的是她的 “惊讶”—— 难道她不知道她们会对彼此说这种话吗？难道这不是正常的吗？</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that, no, the adults don’t know what the kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like us, they don’t like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don’t see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.</p>
<p>重要的是要明白：不，成年人根本不知道孩子们在彼此做什么。他们抽象地知道，孩子们会残忍地对待彼此，就像我们抽象地知道贫穷国家有人遭受酷刑一样。但和我们一样，他们不想细想这个令人沮丧的事实，而且除非刻意去看，否则他们看不到具体的虐待证据。</p>
<p>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens’ main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I’ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>公立学校的老师，处境很像监狱看守。看守最关心的是把囚犯关在范围内，给他们饭吃，尽可能防止他们互相残杀。除此之外，他们不想和囚犯有太多交集，所以让他们自己形成社会结构。据我所知，囚犯们创造的社会是扭曲、野蛮且无处不在的，处于底层的人日子尤其难过。</p>
<p>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that they didn’t want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we created was barbaric.</p>
<p>我就读的学校，大体也是如此。最重要的是把孩子留在校园里。在学校里，校方给他们饭吃，阻止公然的暴力，还会努力教点东西。但除此之外，他们不想和孩子有太多牵扯。就像监狱看守一样，老师大多让我们自生自灭。而我们创造的文化，也像囚犯的文化一样野蛮。</p>
<p>Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that the answer is simply that it’s populated by adults, who are too mature to pick on one another. But I don’t think this is true. Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently, do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.</p>
<p>为什么现实世界对书呆子更友好？似乎答案是：现实世界里都是成年人，他们成熟到不会互相排挤。但我不这么认为。监狱里的成年人当然会互相排挤，显然，某些社交圈里的贵妇也是如此 —— 在曼哈顿的某些地方，女人的生活听起来就像高中的延续，充满了同样琐碎的勾心斗角。</p>
<p>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it’s populated by adults, but that it’s very large, and the things you do have real effects. That’s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.</p>
<p>我觉得现实世界的关键不是 “都是成年人”，而是它足够大，而且你做的事会产生真实的影响。这正是学校、监狱和 “贵妇社交圈” 所缺乏的。在那些世界里，人们被困在小泡泡里，做什么都只能产生局部影响。这种社会自然会堕落成野蛮状态 —— 它们的形式没有对应的功能。</p>
<p>When the things you do have real effects, it’s no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers, and that’s where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills, he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.</p>
<p>当你做的事有真实影响时，仅仅 “讨人喜欢” 就不够了。“得出正确答案” 开始变得重要，而这正是书呆子的优势。比尔・盖茨就是个例子 —— 尽管他的社交能力出了名地差，但他能得出正确答案（至少从收入来看是这样）。</p>
<p>The other thing that’s different about the real world is that it’s much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the wall as he walked down a corridor.</p>
<p>现实世界的另一个不同是它足够大。在足够大的群体里，哪怕是最小的少数群体，只要聚集起来就能形成 “临界质量”。在现实世界里，书呆子会聚集在某些地方，形成自己的社会，在那里智力是最重要的。有时风向甚至会反过来：尤其是在大学的数学系和科学系，书呆子会故意放大自己的笨拙，来显得更聪明。约翰・纳什非常崇拜诺伯特・维纳，甚至学他走路时扶着墙的习惯。</p>
<p>As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn’t have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, the world. The world seemed cruel and boring, and I’m not sure which was worse.</p>
<p>13 岁时，我的眼界只限于眼前的世界。我以为我们生活的那个扭曲的小世界就是全部世界。这个世界既残酷又无聊，我都不知道哪个更糟。</p>
<p>Because I didn’t fit into this world, I thought that something must be wrong with me. I didn’t realize that the reason we nerds didn’t fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others.</p>
<p>因为我不适应这个世界，我觉得一定是自己有问题。但我没意识到，书呆子不适应的原因，在某些方面是因为我们领先了一步 —— 我们已经在思考现实世界中重要的事，而不是像其他人那样，把所有时间都花在玩一个严苛却多半无意义的游戏上。</p>
<p>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school. He wouldn’t know the right clothes to wear, the right music to like, the right slang to use. He’d seem to the kids a complete alien. The thing is, he’d know enough not to care what they thought. We had no such confidence.</p>
<p>我们有点像突然被扔回初中的成年人 —— 他不知道该穿什么衣服、该喜欢什么音乐、该说什么俚语，在孩子们看来就是个彻头彻尾的异类。但关键是，他知道不必在乎孩子们的看法。而我们没有这种自信。</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to think it’s good for smart kids to be thrown together with “normal” kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don’t fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a “pep rally” at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual.</p>
<p>很多人似乎认为，让聪明的孩子在这个阶段和 “正常” 孩子混在一起是好事。或许吧。但至少在某些情况下，书呆子不适应的原因，真的是其他人太疯狂了。我记得高中时坐在 “ pep rally”（动员大会）的观众席上，看着啦啦队员把对手球员的模拟像扔到观众席上让大家撕碎，感觉自己像个探险家，目睹着某种怪异的部落仪式。</p>
<p>If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice, the main thing I’d tell him would be to stick his head up and look around. I didn’t really grasp it at the time, but the whole world we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children.</p>
<p>要是能回到过去，给 13 岁的自己一点建议，我最想说的是：抬起头，看看周围。那时候我没意识到，我们生活的整个世界，就像奶油蛋糕一样虚假 —— 不只是学校，整个小镇都是。人们为什么搬到郊区？为了养孩子！所以难怪这里显得无聊又乏味 —— 整个地方就是个巨大的托儿所，一个为了养孩子而刻意创造的人造小镇。</p>
<p>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing to do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could endanger children.</p>
<p>我长大的地方，感觉无处可去，无事可做。这不是偶然 —— 郊区的设计就是为了隔绝外部世界，因为外部世界有会伤害孩子的东西。</p>
<p>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.</p>
<p>至于学校，不过是这个虚假世界里的 “拘留所”。官方说学校的目的是教孩子，但实际上，主要目的是把孩子关在一个地方一整天，好让成年人能做事。这一点我没意见：在一个专业化的工业社会里，让孩子乱跑会是灾难。</p>
<p>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that (a) they aren’t told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they’re called misfits.</p>
<p>让我不满的不是孩子被关在 “监狱” 里，而是：（a）没人告诉他们这一点；（b）“监狱” 主要由 “囚犯” 管理。孩子们被送去花六年时间背诵无意义的知识，而这个世界由一群追着椭圆形棕色球跑的 “巨人” 统治，仿佛这是世界上最自然的事。要是他们对这种荒诞的设定有异议，就会被叫做 “不合群的人”。</p>
<p>Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just for the nerds. Like any war, it’s damaging even to the winners.</p>
<p>在这个扭曲的世界里，孩子们的生活充满压力 —— 不只是书呆子。就像任何战争一样，即使是赢家也会受伤。</p>
<p>Adults can’t avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why don’t they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty. The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that monstrous new chemicals, hormones, are now coursing through their bloodstream and messing up everything. There’s nothing wrong with the system; it’s just inevitable that kids will be miserable at that age.</p>
<p>成年人不可能没发现青少年在受苦，那为什么不做点什么？因为他们把这归咎于青春期。成年人告诉自己，孩子之所以不开心，是因为可怕的新化学物质 —— 荷尔蒙 —— 在他们的血液里流动，把一切都搞乱了。制度没问题，孩子在这个年纪痛苦是不可避免的。</p>
<p>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which probably doesn’t help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing the wrong size shoes.</p>
<p>这种想法太普遍了，连孩子自己都信，这可能更糟。要是有人觉得自己的脚天生就疼，他是不会停下来想想可能是鞋不合脚的。</p>
<p>I’m suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are intrinsically messed up. If it’s physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I’ve read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they weren’t crazy.</p>
<p>我很怀疑 “13 岁的孩子天生就会捣乱” 这种说法。要是这是生理原因，那应该是普遍现象。蒙古游牧民族的 13 岁孩子都很虚无主义吗？我读了很多历史，没在 20 世纪之前见过任何关于这种 “普遍现象” 的记载。文艺复兴时期的学徒青少年，似乎都很快乐、很积极。他们当然也会打架、互相恶作剧（米开朗基罗的鼻子就被恶霸打断过），但他们不疯狂。</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia. I don’t think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they’re made to lead. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.</p>
<p>据我所知，“荷尔蒙驱动的疯狂青少年” 这种概念，和郊区的出现是同时的。我觉得这不是巧合 —— 青少年被他们被迫过的生活逼疯了。文艺复兴时期的学徒是 “工作犬”，现在的青少年是 “神经质的宠物犬”。他们的疯狂，和所有无所事事的人</p>
<p>When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter kids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and some may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic. But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.</p>
<p>我上学时，自杀是聪明孩子间的常见话题。我认识的人中没人真的这么做，但有几个计划过，有些人可能尝试过。多数时候，这只是一种姿态 —— 和其他青少年一样，我们喜欢戏剧化的东西，而自杀看起来很有戏剧性。但部分原因是，我们的生活有时确实很痛苦。</p>
<p>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on. Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity. And all the work we did was pointless, or seemed so at the time.</p>
<p>霸凌只是问题的一部分。另一个问题，或许更严重的是，我们从来没有真正有意义的事可做。人类喜欢工作；在世界上大多数地方，工作是身份的一部分。而我们做的所有事都毫无意义，至少当时看来是这样。</p>
<p>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future, so far that we didn’t even know at the time what we were practicing for. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump through, words without content designed mainly for testability. (The three main causes of the Civil War were…. Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)</p>
<p>往好里说，这些事是为遥远未来的真正工作做准备，但未来太远了，我们当时甚至不知道在为什么做准备。更多时候，这些事只是一系列随意设定的 “关卡”—— 空洞的文字，主要是为了方便考试。（比如：内战的三个主要原因是…… 考试题目：列出内战的三个主要原因。）</p>
<p>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among themselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way to escape this empty life was to submit to it.</p>
<p>而且没有退出的办法。大人们一致认为，这是通往大学的必经之路。逃离这种空虚生活的唯一方式，就是屈服于它。</p>
<p>Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They weren’t left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.</p>
<p>过去的青少年在社会中扮演更积极的角色。前工业化时代，他们都是某种学徒，无论是在商店、农场，甚至军舰上。他们不会被丢去自己创造社会，而是成年人社会的初级成员。</p>
<p>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is precious little) between schoolwork and the work they’ll do as adults.</p>
<p>那时候的青少年似乎更尊重成年人，因为成年人是他们想学的技能的可见专家。现在，大多数孩子几乎不知道父母在遥远的办公室里做什么，也看不到学业和未来工作之间的联系（事实上，这种联系也确实少得可怜）。</p>
<p>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use for teenagers. After a couple years’ training, an apprentice could be a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry messages or sweep the workshop.</p>
<p>如果说过去的青少年更尊重成年人，那成年人也更需要青少年。经过几年培训，学徒就能真正帮上忙。就算是最新来的学徒，也能被派去送信或打扫车间。</p>
<p>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in the way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they were going away for the weekend.</p>
<p>现在的成年人对青少年没有即时需求。他们在办公室里只会碍手碍脚。所以大人们上班时把他们送到学校，就像周末出门时把狗送到 kennel（犬舍）一样。</p>
<p>What happened? We’re up against a hard one here. The cause of this problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization. As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them. Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far earlier. Now kids who go to college don’t start working full-time till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not finish your training till 30.</p>
<p>到底发生了什么？这是个棘手的问题。导致这个问题的原因，和导致许多现存问题的原因一样：专业化。随着工作越来越专业化，我们需要更长时间的培训。前工业化时代的孩子最晚 14 岁就开始工作；大多数人生活的农场里，孩子开始工作的时间更早。现在，上大学的孩子要到 21 或 22 岁才开始全职工作。有些学位，比如医学博士或哲学博士，可能要到 30 岁才能完成培训。</p>
<p>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost any other kind of work, they’d be a net loss. But they’re also too young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.</p>
<p>现在的青少年没什么用，除了在快餐等行业做廉价劳动力 —— 这些行业的发展正是为了利用这一点。在几乎所有其他工作中，他们都是 “净亏损”。但他们又太年轻，不能没人看管。总得有人看着他们，最有效的方式就是把他们集中在一个地方，让几个成年人就能看管所有人。</p>
<p>If you stop there, what you’re describing is literally a prison, albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically do stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids. But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don’t really take it seriously– not even the smart kids. Much of the time we were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.</p>
<p>如果事情只到这一步，那描述的简直就是监狱，尽管是兼职的。问题是，很多学校实际上就止步于此。学校宣称的目的是教育孩子，但没有外部压力要求他们做好这件事。所以大多数学校教得一塌糊涂，孩子们根本不当回事 —— 即使是聪明的孩子也一样。很多时候，我们所有人，无论是学生还是老师，都只是在走过场。</p>
<p>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo’s Les Miserables. I don’t think any of us knew French well enough to make our way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I just skimmed the Cliff’s Notes. When we were given a test on the book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of long words that our teacher wouldn’t have used. Where had these questions come from? From the Cliff’s Notes, it turned out. The teacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.</p>
<p>我高中的法语课上，我们本该读雨果的《悲惨世界》。但我觉得我们中没人的法语好到能读懂这本巨著。和班上其他人一样，我只是浏览了《克利夫笔记》（名著摘要）。考试时，我发现题目听起来很奇怪 —— 满是老师不会用的长单词。这些题目来自哪里？结果是《克利夫笔记》。老师也在用。我们都在装样子。</p>
<p>There are certainly great public school teachers. The energy and imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that year something his students still talk about, thirty years later. But teachers like him were individuals swimming upstream. They couldn’t fix the system.</p>
<p>当然，公立学校里有很棒的老师。我四年级的老师米哈尔科先生，他的活力和想象力让那一年成了学生们三十年后还在谈论的话题。但像他这样的老师，只是逆流而上的个体，无法改变整个系统。</p>
<p>In almost any group of people you’ll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it’s generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.</p>
<p>几乎任何群体中都存在等级制度。现实世界中，成年人形成群体通常是为了某个共同目标，而领导者最终是那些最擅长实现目标的人。大多数学校的问题在于，它们没有目标。但等级制度必须存在，所以孩子们凭空创造了一个。</p>
<p>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation degenerates into a popularity contest. And that’s exactly what happens in most American schools. Instead of depending on some real test, one’s rank depends mostly on one’s ability to increase one’s rank. It’s like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the kids become one another’s opponents.</p>
<p>我们有个短语来描述 “没有有意义的标准却要排名” 的情况：我们说这种情况会退化成 “ popularity contest（人气竞赛）”。这正是大多数美国学校的现状。一个人的排名不取决于任何真正的考验，而主要取决于他提升自己排名的能力。就像路易十四的宫廷 —— 没有外部对手，所以孩子们就成了彼此的对手。</p>
<p>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn’t painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team doesn’t resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him. The veteran may in turn feel a sense of noblesse oblige. And most importantly, their status depends on how well they do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.</p>
<p>当存在真正的外部技能考验时，处于等级底层并不痛苦。足球队的新手不会嫉妒老将的技能；他希望有一天能像老将一样，并且很高兴有机会向他学习。老将反过来可能会有 “noblesse oblige（位高则任重）” 的责任感。最重要的是，他们的地位取决于对抗外部对手的表现，而不是能否打压他人。</p>
<p>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society debases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the bottom, nor noblesse oblige at the top. It’s kill or be killed.</p>
<p>宫廷式的等级制度则完全不同。这种社会会贬低所有进入其中的人。底层没有钦佩，顶层没有责任感。这是一个要么踩别人，要么被别人踩的世界。</p>
<p>This is the sort of society that gets created in American secondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain number of hours each day. What I didn’t realize at the time, and in fact didn’t realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same cause.</p>
<p>这就是美国中学里形成的社会。之所以会这样，是因为这些学校除了把孩子们每天关在一个地方几小时之外，没有任何真正的目的。我当时没意识到，直到最近才明白：学校生活的两大恐怖 —— 残忍和无聊，有着相同的根源。</p>
<p>The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness that actively drives kids away from the things they’re supposed to be learning.</p>
<p>美国公立学校的平庸造成的后果，远不止让孩子们在六年里不开心。它滋生了叛逆，让孩子们主动远离他们本该学习的东西。</p>
<p>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I could bring myself to read anything we’d been assigned then. And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like “character” and “integrity” because they had been so debased by adults. As they were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing: obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers. If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of them.</p>
<p>和很多书呆子一样，高中毕业后过了很多年，我才愿意读那些当年被布置的读物。我失去的不止是书籍。我不信任 “character（品格）” 和 “ integrity（正直）” 这类词，因为成年人把它们贬低了。在当时的语境里，这些词似乎都意味着同一个东西：服从。因这些品质而受表扬的孩子，往好里说是愚钝的 “奖牛”，往坏里说是油滑的奉承者。如果这就是品格和正直，我一点也不想要。</p>
<p>The word I most misunderstood was “tact.” As used by adults, it seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut. I assumed it was derived from the same root as “tacit” and “taciturn,” and that it literally meant being quiet. I vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut me up. In fact, it’s derived from the same root as “tactile,” and what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of clumsy. I don’t think I learned this until college.</p>
<p>我最误解的词是 “tact（得体）”。在成年人的用法里，它似乎意味着闭嘴。我以为它和 “ tacit（默许的）”、“ taciturn（沉默寡言的）” 同源，字面意思就是安静。我发誓永远不要 “得体”，他们别想让我闭嘴。但事实上，它和 “ tactile（触觉的）” 同源，意思是 “灵巧的手法”。“得体” 是 “笨拙” 的反义词。我大概到大学才明白这一点。</p>
<p>Nerds aren’t the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are unpopular because they’re distracted. There are other kids who deliberately opt out because they’re so disgusted with the whole process.</p>
<p>在人气竞赛中，书呆子不是唯一的输家。书呆子不受欢迎是因为他们分心了。还有些孩子因为对整个过程极度反感，故意选择退出。</p>
<p>Teenage kids, even rebels, don’t like to be alone, so when kids opt out of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana. The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called “freaks.”</p>
<p>青少年即使是叛逆者，也不喜欢独处，所以当他们选择退出系统时，往往会结成群体。在我就读的学校里，叛逆的焦点是吸毒，特别是大麻。这个群体的孩子穿黑色摇滚 T 恤，被叫做 “freaks（怪胎）”。</p>
<p>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap between them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids, though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an important tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was friends with a lot of freaks.</p>
<p>怪胎和书呆子是盟友，两者有很多重叠。怪胎总体上比其他孩子聪明，尽管 “从不学习（或至少看起来不学习）” 是这个群体的重要价值观。我更属于书呆子阵营，但和很多怪胎是朋友。</p>
<p>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they created. It was something to do together, and because the drugs were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.</p>
<p>他们吸毒，至少一开始是为了建立社交联系。这是他们可以一起做的事，而且因为毒品是非法的，这成了他们共同的叛逆标志。</p>
<p>I’m not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum. No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from other problems– trouble at home, for example. But, in my school at least, the reason most kids started using drugs was rebellion. Fourteen-year-olds didn’t start smoking pot because they’d heard it would help them forget their problems. They started because they wanted to join a different tribe.</p>
<p>我不是说糟糕的学校是孩子们陷入毒品问题的全部原因。过一段时间后，毒品会有自己的惯性。毫无疑问，有些怪胎最终吸毒是为了逃避其他问题 —— 比如家庭麻烦。但至少在我的学校里，大多数孩子开始吸毒的原因是叛逆。14 岁的孩子开始抽大麻，不是因为听说这能帮他们忘记烦恼，而是因为他们想加入另一个群体。</p>
<p>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>暴政滋生叛乱，这不是什么新观点。但当局大多仍然表现得好像毒品本身就是问题的根源。</p>
<p>The real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won’t see solutions till adults realize that. The adults who may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in school. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as you were? I wouldn’t. Well, then, is there anything we can do to fix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the current system. It has come about mostly by default.</p>
<p>真正的问题是学校生活的空虚。除非成年人意识到这一点，否则我们看不到解决方案。最先意识到这一点的成年人，可能是那些自己上学时是书呆子的人。你想让你的孩子在八年级时和你当年一样不开心吗？我不想。那么，我们能做些什么来改变现状呢？几乎可以肯定的是，现行制度并非不可改变，它的形成很大程度上是默认的结果。</p>
<p>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing. Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few will have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest part is realizing that you can.</p>
<p>但成年人很忙。出席学校的戏剧表演是一回事，对抗教育官僚体系是另一回事。或许有少数人有精力尝试改变，但我怀疑最难的是意识到 “自己有能力改变”。</p>
<p>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to rescue you, but they probably won’t be coming this month. Any immediate improvement in nerds’ lives is probably going to have to come from the nerds themselves.</p>
<p>还在上学的书呆子别抱太大期望。也许有一天，一队全副武装的成年人会乘直升机来救你们，但这个月可能不会。书呆子生活的任何即时改善，很可能都得靠他们自己。</p>
<p>Merely understanding the situation they’re in should make it less painful. Nerds aren’t losers. They’re just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It’s hard to find successful adults now who don’t claim to have been nerds in high school.</p>
<p>仅仅理解自己所处的环境，就应该能减少痛苦。书呆子不是失败者。他们只是在玩另一种游戏，一种更接近现实世界的游戏。成年人明白这一点 —— 现在很难找到成功的成年人不宣称自己高中时是书呆子。</p>
<p>It’s important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It’s all-encompassing, like life, but it isn’t the real thing. It’s only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you’re still in it.</p>
<p>书呆子也需要意识到，学校不是生活。学校是一种奇怪的人造产物，一半无菌，一半野性。它像生活一样包罗万象，但不是真实的生活。它只是暂时的，即使还在其中，只要你愿意，就能看到它之外的东西。</p>
<p>If life seems awful to kids, it’s neither because hormones are turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because life actually is awful (as you believe). It’s because the adults, who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do. Any society of that type is awful to live in. You don’t have to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.</p>
<p>如果孩子们觉得生活很糟糕，既不是因为荷尔蒙把你们都变成了怪物（就像父母认为的那样），也不是因为生活本身真的很糟糕（就像你们认为的那样）。而是因为，不再有经济用途的成年人，把你们丢在一起，让你们多年来无所事事。任何这样的社会，生活起来都很糟糕。这就足以解释为什么青少年不开心了。</p>
<p>I’ve said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis is an optimistic one– that several problems we take for granted are in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently unhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults both.</p>
<p>我在这篇文章里说了些尖锐的话，但核心论点其实是乐观的 —— 一些我们习以为常的问题，其实并非无法解决。青少年并非天生就是不开心的怪物。这对孩子和成年人来说，都应该是个鼓舞人心的消息。</p>
