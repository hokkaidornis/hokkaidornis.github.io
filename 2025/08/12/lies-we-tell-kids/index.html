<p>May 2008</p>
<p>Adults lie constantly to kids. I’m not saying we should stop, but I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.</p>
<p>成年人一直在对孩子撒谎。我不是说我们应该停止，但我认为至少应该审视一下我们撒了哪些谎，以及为什么要撒这些谎。</p>
<p>There may also be a benefit to us. We were all lied to as kids, and some of the lies we were told still affect us. So by studying the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of lies we were told.</p>
<p>这对我们自己或许也有好处。我们小时候都被撒过谎，有些谎言至今仍在影响我们。所以，通过研究成年人对孩子撒谎的方式，我们或许能理清那些被灌输的谎言。</p>
<p>I’m using the word “lie” in a very general sense: not just overt falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids. Though “lie” has negative connotations, I don’t mean to suggest we should never do this—just that we should pay attention when we do. [1]</p>
<p>我对 “谎言” 的定义很宽泛：不仅包括明显的假话，还包括所有那些更微妙的、误导孩子的方式。尽管 “谎言” 带有负面含义，但我并不是说我们永远不该这么做 —— 只是说，当我们这么做时，应该多加留意。[1]</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is how broad the conspiracy is. All adults know what their culture lies to kids about: they’re the questions you answer “Ask your parents.” If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982 or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him. But if a kid asks you “Is there a God?” or “What’s a prostitute?” you’ll probably say “Ask your parents.”</p>
<p>成年人对孩子撒谎的方式中，最值得注意的一点是，这种 “共谋” 的范围有多广。所有成年人都知道自己的文化中哪些是对孩子隐瞒的内容：这些问题的答案通常是 “去问你爸妈”。如果孩子问 1982 年谁赢了世界职业棒球大赛，或者碳的原子量是多少，你可以直接告诉他。但如果孩子问 “有上帝吗？” 或者 “妓女是什么？”，你很可能会说 “去问你爸妈”。</p>
<p>Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world presented to them. The biggest disagreements are between parents and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the school into keeping quiet or move their kids to a new school.</p>
<p>因为我们都达成了共识，所以孩子眼中的世界图景几乎没有破绽。最大的分歧存在于父母和学校之间，但即便如此也微不足道。学校在有争议的话题上会谨言慎行，如果他们的说法与父母希望孩子相信的内容相悖，父母要么会向学校施压让其保持沉默，要么会把孩子转到另一所学校。</p>
<p>The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so only by discovering internal contradictions in what they’re told. It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation. Here’s what happened to Einstein:</p>
<p>这种 “共谋” 如此彻底，以至于大多数孩子发现真相的方式，只是通过发现被告知的内容中存在内在矛盾。对那些在 “骗局” 中醒悟的孩子来说，这可能是创伤性的。爱因斯坦就有过这样的经历：</p>
<p>Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression. [2]</p>
<p>通过阅读通俗科学书籍，我很快确信，圣经故事中的很多内容不可能是真的。结果是，我产生了一种极度狂热的自由思想，同时觉得国家在故意通过谎言欺骗年轻人：这是一种毁灭性的印象。[2]</p>
<p>I remember that feeling. By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt from end to end. That’s why movies like The Matrix have such resonance. Every kid grows up in a fake world. In a way it would be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by taking a pill.</p>
<p>我记得那种感觉。15 岁时，我确信这个世界从头到尾都是腐朽的。这就是为什么《黑客帝国》这样的电影能引起如此强烈的共鸣。每个孩子都是在一个虚假的世界里长大的。从某种意义上说，如果幕后的力量能像一群邪恶的机器那样界限分明，只要吃一粒药丸就能彻底决裂，或许会更容易些。</p>
<h3 id="Protection"><a href="#Protection" class="headerlink" title="Protection"></a><strong>Protection</strong></h3><p><strong>保护</strong></p>
<p>If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they give is to protect them. And kids do need protecting. The environment you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the streets of a big city.</p>
<p>如果你问成年人为什么要对孩子撒谎，最常见的理由是 “为了保护他们”。而孩子确实需要保护。你想为新生儿创造的环境，与大城市的街道截然不同。</p>
<p>That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie. It’s certainly not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is quiet and warm and safe. But this harmless type of lie can turn sour if left unexamined.</p>
<p>这似乎显而易见，以至于称其为 “谎言” 都显得不妥。给婴儿营造一个安静、温暖、安全的世界印象，当然不是什么恶意的谎言。但这种无害的谎言如果不加审视，可能会变味。</p>
<p>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn till age 18. To mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse. That’s an extreme example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes national news. But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.</p>
<p>想象一下，如果你试图让一个人在像新生儿那样受保护的环境中待到 18 岁。如此严重地误导一个人对世界的认知，与其说是保护，不如说是虐待。当然，这是一个极端的例子；父母如果真的这么做，会成为全国新闻。但在郊区青少年的萎靡不振中，你能看到同样的问题，只是规模较小。</p>
<p>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in. And it seems great for 10 year olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn’t notice how sterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends’ houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in. On a log scale I was midway between crib and globe. A suburban street was just the right size. But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake.</p>
<p>郊区的主要目的是为孩子提供一个受保护的成长环境。对 10 岁的孩子来说，这似乎很棒。我 10 岁时就喜欢住在郊区，没注意到那里有多乏味。我的世界就局限在几个可以骑车去的朋友家，以及一片可以跑来跑去的树林。按对数尺度来看，我正处于婴儿床和整个世界的中间。郊区的街道大小刚刚好。但随着年龄增长，郊区开始让人觉得窒息般虚假。</p>
<p>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it’s often frustrating at 15. This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed for 10 year olds.</p>
<p>10 岁或 20 岁时，生活可能很美好，但 15 岁时往往充满挫败感。这是一个太大的问题，无法在这里解决，但 15 岁的生活之所以糟糕，一个原因无疑是孩子被困在一个为 10 岁孩子设计的世界里。</p>
<p>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them in suburbia? A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3 year old daughter “saw too much.” Off the top of my head, that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger.</p>
<p>父母希望通过在郊区抚养孩子，保护他们免受什么伤害呢？一个从曼哈顿搬出去的朋友只说，她 3 岁的女儿 “看到的太多了”。我随口就能想到，这些 “太多” 可能包括：吸毒或醉酒的人、贫困、精神失常、可怕的疾病、各种怪异的性行为，以及暴怒。</p>
<p>I think it’s the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year old. I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even then. I wouldn’t want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I saw. It would be too frightening. A lot of the things adults conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they’d be frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such things. Misleading the child is just a byproduct.</p>
<p>如果我有一个 3 岁的孩子，我想最让我担心的是 “暴怒”。我 29 岁搬到纽约时，依然对此感到惊讶。我不希望一个 3 岁的孩子看到我见过的一些争执，那太可怕了。成年人对小孩子隐瞒的很多事情，是因为这些事情会吓到他们，而不是想隐瞒这些事情的存在。误导孩子只是副产品。</p>
<p>This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to kids. But because the lies are indirect we don’t keep a very strict accounting of them. Parents know they’ve concealed the facts about sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more. But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in. Combine this with the confidence parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.</p>
<p>这似乎是成年人对孩子撒谎中最合理的一种。但因为这些谎言是间接的，我们并没有严格地去核算它们。父母知道自己隐瞒了性知识，很多人会在某个时候坐下来给孩子做更多解释。但很少有父母会告诉孩子，真实世界与他们成长的 “保护罩” 之间有什么不同。再加上父母试图给孩子灌输的自信，每年都会有一批 18 岁的年轻人觉得自己懂得如何管理世界。</p>
<p>Don’t all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world? Actually this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old. In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings. They could see they weren’t as strong or skillful as the village smith. In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment are a recent invention. Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got this first. Children of kings and great magnates were the first to grow up out of touch with the world. Suburbia means half the population can live like kings in that respect.</p>
<p>难道所有 18 岁的人都觉得自己懂得如何管理世界吗？实际上，这似乎是最近的新现象，不超过 100 年。在前工业化时代，青少年是成人世界的初级成员，相对清楚自己的不足。他们能看到自己不如村里的铁匠强壮或熟练。过去，人们在某些事情上对孩子的谎言比现在多，但这种隐含在人为保护环境中的谎言是最近才出现的。就像很多新发明一样，富人先享受到了。国王和大贵族的孩子是最早在与世界脱节的环境中长大的。郊区意味着一半的人口在这方面能像国王一样生活。</p>
<h3 id="Sex-and-Drugs"><a href="#Sex-and-Drugs" class="headerlink" title="Sex (and Drugs)"></a><strong>Sex (and Drugs)</strong></h3><p><strong>性（与毒品）</strong></p>
<p>I’d have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York. I’d worry less about what they’d see, and more about what they’d do. I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan, and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded. They seemed to have lost their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried more drugs than I’d even heard of.</p>
<p>如果在纽约抚养十几岁的孩子，我的担忧会有所不同。我不太担心他们会看到什么，更担心他们会做什么。我上大学时认识很多在曼哈顿长大的孩子，总的来说，他们似乎相当世故。他们似乎平均 14 岁就失去了童贞，到了大学，尝试过的毒品比我听说过的还多。</p>
<p>The reasons parents don’t want their teenage kids having sex are complex. There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. But those aren’t the only reasons parents don’t want their kids having sex. The average parents of a 14 year old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>父母不希望十几岁的孩子发生性行为，原因很复杂。有一些明显的危险：怀孕和性传播疾病。但这并不是父母不希望孩子发生性行为的唯一原因。一个 14 岁女孩的普通父母，即使完全没有怀孕或性传播疾病的风险，也会厌恶她发生性行为的想法。</p>
<p>Kids can probably sense they aren’t being told the whole story. After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as much a problem for adults, and they have sex.</p>
<p>孩子可能能感觉到他们没有被告知全部真相。毕竟，怀孕和性传播疾病对成年人来说也是问题，但成年人依然会有性行为。</p>
<p>What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex? Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it’s probably inborn. But if it’s inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of societies where parents don’t mind if their teenage kids have sex—indeed, where it’s normal for 14 year olds to become mothers. So what’s going on? There does seem to be a universal taboo against sex with prepubescent children. One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that. And I think this is the main reason parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having sex. They still think of them as children, even though biologically they’re not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.</p>
<p>父母真正介意十几岁的孩子发生性行为的原因是什么？他们对这个想法的反感如此本能，可能是与生俱来的。但如果这是与生俱来的，那它应该是普遍的，然而很多社会中，父母并不介意十几岁的孩子发生性行为 —— 事实上，14 岁成为母亲是很正常的。所以到底是怎么回事？似乎存在一种普遍的禁忌，反对与青春期前的儿童发生性行为。我们可以想象这背后的进化原因。而我认为，这是工业化社会的父母不喜欢青少年发生性行为的主要原因：他们仍然把青少年当作孩子，尽管从生物学上来说他们不是，所以对儿童性行为的禁忌依然有效。</p>
<p>One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs: that it can cause great pleasure. That’s what makes sex and drugs so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one’s judgement—which is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the already wretched judgement of a teenage kid.</p>
<p>成年人对性隐瞒的事情，对毒品也一样：它们能带来极大的快感。这正是性和毒品的危险之处。对它们的渴望会模糊人的判断力 —— 当被模糊的是青少年本就糟糕的判断力时，尤其令人恐惧。</p>
<p>Here parents’ desires conflict. Older societies told kids they had bad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident. This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly lied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they believed us.</p>
<p>这里存在父母的愿望冲突。更古老的社会会告诉孩子他们的判断力很差，但现代父母希望孩子自信。这很可能比过去那种 “让他们认清自己位置” 的做法更好，但副作用是：在含蓄地对孩子撒谎，说他们的判断力很好之后，我们又不得不再次撒谎，隐瞒那些如果他们相信了我们的话，可能会陷入麻烦的事情。</p>
<p>If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would be: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy judgement. People with twice your experience still get burned by them. But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn’t be convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is believing you have good judgement. When you’re too weak to lift something, you can tell, but when you’re making a decision impetuously, you’re all the more sure of it.</p>
<p>如果父母告诉孩子关于性和毒品的真相，应该是这样的：你应该避开这些东西，是因为你的判断力很差。比你有更多经验的人，依然会被它们伤害。但这可能是那种真相无法令人信服的情况，因为判断力差的一个表现就是，认为自己的判断力很好。当你举不起某个东西时，你能知道；但当你鲁莽地做决定时，你反而更确信自己是对的。</p>
<h3 id="Innocence"><a href="#Innocence" class="headerlink" title="Innocence"></a><strong>Innocence</strong></h3><p><strong>纯真</strong></p>
<p>Another reason parents don’t want their kids having sex is that they want to keep them innocent. Adults have a certain model of how kids are supposed to behave, and it’s different from what they expect of other adults.</p>
<p>父母不希望孩子发生性行为的另一个原因，是想让他们保持纯真。成年人对孩子应该有的行为有一个特定的模式，这与他们对其他成年人的期望不同。</p>
<p>One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed to use. Most parents use words when talking to other adults that they wouldn’t want their kids using. They try to hide even the existence of these words for as long as they can. And this is another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone knows you’re not supposed to swear in front of kids.</p>
<p>最明显的区别之一是孩子被允许使用的词汇。大多数父母在和其他成年人说话时会用一些词，却不希望自己的孩子用。他们会尽可能长时间地隐瞒这些词的存在。这也是所有人都参与的 “共谋” 之一：大家都知道不应该在孩子面前说脏话。</p>
<p>I’ve never heard more different explanations for anything parents tell kids than why they shouldn’t swear. Every parent I know forbids their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same justification. It’s clear most start with not wanting kids to swear, then make up the reason afterward.</p>
<p>关于为什么不应该让孩子说脏话，我听过的父母解释差异最大。我认识的每个父母都禁止孩子说脏话，但没有两个人的理由是一样的。很明显，大多数父母是先不希望孩子说脏话，然后才编造理由。</p>
<p>So my theory about what’s going on is that the function of swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult. There’s no difference in the meaning of “shit” and “poopoo.” So why should one be ok for kids to say and one forbidden? The only explanation is: by definition. [3]</p>
<p>所以我的理论是，脏话的作用是标志说话者是成年人。“狗屁” 和 “便便” 的意思没有区别。那为什么一个允许孩子说，另一个却禁止呢？唯一的解释是：定义如此。[3]</p>
<p>Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for adults? The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth is very disconcerting. But why?</p>
<p>为什么成年人会如此在意孩子做那些专属于成年人的事情？一个满嘴脏话、愤世嫉俗的 10 岁孩子，斜靠在路灯柱上，嘴角叼着烟，这种画面非常令人不安。但为什么呢？</p>
<p>One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we’re programmed to like certain kinds of helplessness. I’ve several times heard mothers say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children’s mispronunciations because they were so cute. And if you think about it, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual limbs.</p>
<p>我们希望孩子纯真，一个原因是我们天生就喜欢某种无助。我好几次听到母亲们说，她们故意不纠正幼儿的发音错误，因为那很可爱。仔细想想，可爱就是无助。那些被设计成可爱的玩具和卡通人物，总是带着懵懂的表情，四肢粗短无力。</p>
<p>It’s not surprising we’d have an inborn desire to love and protect helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for so long. Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they’d be very annoying. They’d merely seem like incompetent adults. But there’s more to it than that. The reason our hypothetical jaded 10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he’d be annoying, but that he’d have cut off his prospects for growth so early. To be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty narrow one.</p>
<p>考虑到人类后代在很长一段时间内都如此无助，我们天生就有爱护和保护无助生物的欲望，这并不奇怪。如果没有那种让孩子显得可爱的无助，他们会非常令人讨厌，就像一群无能的成年人。但不止于此。我们假设的那个世故的 10 岁孩子让我不安，不仅因为他会令人讨厌，还因为他过早地切断了自己成长的可能性。要变得世故，你必须认为自己知道世界是如何运作的，而一个 10 岁孩子对世界的任何理论，很可能都非常狭隘。</p>
<p>Innocence is also open-mindedness. We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn. Paradoxical as it sounds, there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of knowledge. If you’re going to learn that the world is a brutal place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you’re better off learning it last. Otherwise you won’t bother learning much more.</p>
<p>纯真也是开放的心态。我们希望孩子纯真，这样他们才能继续学习。听起来矛盾，但有些知识会阻碍其他知识的学习。如果你要学习这个世界是一个残酷的地方，充满了想利用他人的人，那最好最后再学这个。否则，你就不会再费心去学更多东西了。</p>
<p>Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don’t think this is a coincidence. I think they’ve deliberately avoided learning about certain things. Certainly I do. I used to think I wanted to know everything. Now I know I don’t.</p>
<p>非常聪明的成年人往往显得异常纯真，我不认为这是巧合。我认为他们故意避免了解某些事情。我当然是这样。我曾经以为自己想知道一切，现在才知道并非如此。</p>
<h3 id="Death"><a href="#Death" class="headerlink" title="Death"></a><strong>Death</strong></h3><p><strong>死亡</strong></p>
<p>After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about to kids. Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos. But why do we conceal death from kids? Probably because small children are particularly horrified by it. They want to feel safe, and death is the ultimate threat.</p>
<p>除了性，成年人对孩子最明显撒谎的话题就是死亡。我认为他们隐瞒性是因为深层的禁忌。但我们为什么要对孩子隐瞒死亡呢？可能是因为小孩子对死亡尤其恐惧。他们想感到安全，而死亡是终极威胁。</p>
<p>One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the death of our first cat. Over the years, as we asked for more details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite elaborate. The cat had died at the vet’s office. Of what? Of the anaesthesia itself. Why was the cat at the vet’s office? To be fixed. And why had such a routine operation killed it? It wasn’t the vet’s fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have known this in advance. It was not till we were in our twenties that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally stepped on the cat and broken its back.</p>
<p>父母对我们撒过的一个惊人谎言，是关于我们第一只猫的死亡。多年来，随着我们追问更多细节，他们不得不编造更多内容，所以这个故事变得相当复杂。猫是在兽医诊所死的。死于什么？死于麻醉本身。猫为什么去兽医诊所？去做绝育手术。为什么一个常规手术会杀死它？这不是兽医的错；猫有先天性心脏病；麻醉对它来说负担太重；但事先没人能知道。直到我们二十多岁，真相才浮出水面：当时大约三岁的妹妹不小心踩到了猫，折断了它的脊椎。</p>
<p>They didn’t feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat heaven. My parents never claimed that people or animals who died had “gone to a better place,” or that we’d meet them again. It didn’t seem to harm us.</p>
<p>他们觉得没必要告诉我们猫现在在 “猫天堂” 过得很快乐。我父母从未说过死去的人或动物 “去了更好的地方”，或者我们会再见到他们。这似乎并没有伤害到我们。</p>
<p>My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my grandfather. She said they’d been sitting reading one day, and when she said something to him, he didn’t answer. He seemed to be asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn’t. “He was gone.” Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep. Later I learned it hadn’t been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most of a day to kill him.</p>
<p>祖母给我们讲了祖父死亡的 “精简版”。她说有一天他们坐着看书，她跟他说话时，他没有回应。他看起来像睡着了，但她想叫醒他时，却做不到。“他就那样走了。” 心脏病发作听起来就像睡着了。后来我才知道，事情并非如此简单，那次心脏病发作花了将近一天才夺走他的生命。</p>
<p>Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing the subject when death came up. I can’t remember that, of course, but I can infer it from the fact that I didn’t really grasp I was going to die till I was about 19. How could I have missed something so obvious for so long? Now that I’ve seen parents managing the subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly turned aside.</p>
<p>除了这种直白的谎言，当死亡话题出现时，他们肯定还会经常转移话题。我当然不记得了，但我能推断出来：因为我直到 19 岁左右才真正明白自己会死。这么明显的事情，我怎么会忽略这么久？现在我看到父母如何处理这个话题，就明白了：关于死亡的问题会被温柔但坚决地岔开。</p>
<p>On this topic, especially, they’re met half-way by kids. Kids often want to be lied to. They want to believe they’re living in a comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe it. [4]</p>
<p>尤其是在这个话题上，孩子在某种程度上也配合着被欺骗。他们和父母一样，想相信自己生活在一个舒适、安全的世界里。[4]</p>
<h3 id="Identity"><a href="#Identity" class="headerlink" title="Identity"></a><strong>Identity</strong></h3><p><strong>身份</strong></p>
<p>Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group and want their kids to feel it too. This usually requires two different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes differentiate themselves by believing. [5]</p>
<p>有些父母强烈认同某个种族或宗教群体，也希望孩子有同样的认同。这通常需要两种不同的谎言：第一种是告诉孩子 “你是 X 群体的人”；第二种是 X 群体为了区分自己而相信的那些特定谎言。[5]</p>
<p>Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity is one of the stickiest things you can tell them. Almost anything else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when they start to think for themselves. But if you tell a kid they’re a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.</p>
<p>告诉孩子他们有特定的种族或宗教身份，是你能对他们说的最棘手的事情之一。你告诉孩子的几乎所有其他事情，他们长大后开始独立思考时，都可以改变想法。但如果你告诉孩子他们是某个群体的成员，这似乎几乎无法动摇。</p>
<p>This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated lies parents tell. When parents are of different religions, they’ll often agree between themselves that their children will be “raised as Xes.” And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen the other way, they’d have grown up considering themselves as Ys.</p>
<p>尽管这可能是父母最蓄意的谎言之一。当父母信仰不同宗教时，他们往往会达成一致，让孩子 “被培养成 X 群体的人”。而且这很有效。孩子们会顺从地长大，认为自己是 X 群体的人，尽管如果父母选择了另一种方式，他们会长大认为自己是 Y 群体的人。</p>
<p>One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved. The truth is common property. You can’t distinguish your group by doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true. If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false. And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by “outsiders” on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous. If they aren’t an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs and customs? If they aren’t an X, why do all the non-Xes call them one?</p>
<p>这种做法之所以如此有效，原因之一在于其中的第二种谎言。真相是共同财产。你不能通过做理性的事、相信真实的事来区分自己的群体。如果你想与他人区分开来，就必须做武断的事，相信虚假的事。当孩子一生都在做武断的事、相信虚假的事，并因此被 “外人” 视为怪异时，推动他们认为自己是 X 群体成员的认知失调一定非常强烈。如果他们不是 X 群体的人，为什么会执着于这些武断的信仰和习俗？如果他们不是 X 群体的人，为什么所有非 X 群体的人都这么称呼他们？</p>
<p>This form of lie is not without its uses. You can use it to carry a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of the child’s identity. You can tell the child that in addition to never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious. Then X children will grow up feeling it’s part of their identity to be honest and industrious.</p>
<p>这种谎言并非毫无用处。你可以用它来传递一些有益的信念，这些信念也会成为孩子身份的一部分。你可以告诉孩子，除了从不穿黄色、相信世界是由一只巨大的兔子创造的、吃鱼前必须打响指之外，X 群体的人还特别诚实和勤奋。然后 X 群体的孩子长大后会觉得，诚实和勤奋是自己身份的一部分。</p>
<p>This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions, and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful and the bizarre. The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick, and the useful half is the payload. [6]</p>
<p>这可能解释了很多现代宗教的传播，也解释了为什么它们的教义是有用内容和怪异内容的结合。怪异的部分让宗教得以维系，有用的部分是负荷( “payload”)。[6]</p>
<h3 id="Authority"><a href="#Authority" class="headerlink" title="Authority"></a><strong>Authority</strong></h3><p><strong>权威</strong></p>
<p>One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain power over them. Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a child molester telling his victims they’ll get in trouble if they tell anyone what happened to them. Others seem more innocent; it depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they use it for.</p>
<p>成年人对孩子撒谎最不可原谅的原因之一，是为了维持对他们的控制。有时这些谎言真的很险恶，比如恋童癖告诉受害者，如果他们告诉别人发生了什么，就会惹上麻烦。其他一些则看似无辜；这取决于成年人为了维持权力撒了多少谎，以及他们用权力做什么。</p>
<p>Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children. Usually their motives are mixed. For example, a father who has an affair generally conceals it from his children. His motive is partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit) that he doesn’t want to tarnish himself in their eyes.</p>
<p>大多数成年人都会努力向孩子隐瞒自己的缺点。他们的动机通常很复杂。例如，一个有外遇的父亲通常会对孩子隐瞒这件事。他的动机一部分是怕孩子担心，一部分是这会引出性话题，还有一部分（比他承认的要多）是不想在孩子眼中玷污自己的形象。</p>
<p>If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any book written to teach them about “issues.” [7] Peter Mayle wrote one called Why Are We Getting a Divorce? It begins with the three most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:<br>You shouldn’t put the blame on one parent, because divorce is never only one person’s fault. [8]</p>
<p>如果你想知道人们对孩子撒了哪些谎，读一读几乎所有为了教他们 “事理” 而写的书。[7] 彼得・梅尔写过一本叫《我们为什么要离婚？》的书。开头列出了关于离婚最需要记住的三件事，其中一件是：<br>你不应该责怪父母中的一方，因为离婚从来都不只是一个人的错。[8]</p>
<p>Really? When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly his wife’s fault? But I can see why Mayle might have said this. Maybe it’s more important for kids to respect their parents than to know the truth about them.</p>
<p>真的吗？当一个男人和他的秘书私奔时，这也总是有他妻子的一部分责任吗？但我能理解梅尔为什么这么说。或许对孩子来说，尊重父母比知道关于他们的真相更重要。</p>
<p>But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling they fall hopelessly short. They walk around feeling horribly evil for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around them are doing much worse things.</p>
<p>但因为成年人隐瞒自己的缺点，同时又坚持让孩子遵守高标准的行为规范，很多孩子长大后觉得自己无可救药地失败了。他们会因为说了一句脏话而觉得自己极其邪恶，而事实上，他们周围的大多数成年人做得更糟。</p>
<p>This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions. The more confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a question “I don’t know.” Less confident people feel they have to have an answer or they’ll look bad. My parents were pretty good about admitting when they didn’t know things, but I must have been told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard a teacher say “I don’t know” till I got to college. I remember because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of a class.</p>
<p>这在知识问题和道德问题上都存在。越自信的人，似乎越愿意回答 “我不知道”。不太自信的人觉得自己必须有答案，否则会显得很糟糕。我的父母很擅长承认自己不知道的事情，但我肯定被老师撒过很多这种谎，因为直到上大学，我才很少听到老师说 “我不知道”。我记得这一点，因为在全班面前听到有人这么说，太令人惊讶了。</p>
<p>The first hint I had that teachers weren’t omniscient came in sixth grade, after my father contradicted something I’d learned in school. When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that he was just an elementary school teacher, after all.</p>
<p>我第一次意识到老师并非无所不知，是在六年级，我父亲反驳了我在学校学到的东西。当我抗议说老师说的正好相反时，父亲回答说，那家伙根本不知道自己在说什么 —— 毕竟，他只是个小学老师。</p>
<p>Just a teacher? The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed. Didn’t teachers know everything about the subjects they taught? And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?</p>
<p>只是个老师？这句话听起来几乎在语法上都不通。老师难道不应该知道他们教的科目里的所有东西吗？如果不是，那为什么是他们来教我们？</p>
<p>The sad fact is, US public school teachers don’t generally understand the stuff they’re teaching very well. There are some sterling exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank academically near the bottom of the college population. So the fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible shows what a job the system must have done on my brain.</p>
<p>可悲的是，美国公立学校的老师通常并不太理解他们所教的内容。当然有一些优秀的例外，但通常来说，打算从事教学工作的人，在大学生中的学术排名接近底部。所以，我 11 岁时还认为老师是不会犯错的，这说明这个系统对我的大脑做了多大的 “改造”。</p>
<h3 id="School"><a href="#School" class="headerlink" title="School"></a><strong>School</strong></h3><p><strong>学校</strong></p>
<p>What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies. The most excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to learn. The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the curriculum in the name of simplification.</p>
<p>孩子在学校学到的东西是谎言的复杂混合体。最可原谅的是那些为了简化概念、方便学习而说的谎。问题是，很多宣传以简化的名义被塞进了课程。</p>
<p>Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various powerful groups want kids to be told. The lies are rarely overt. Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing certain topics at the expense of others. The view of history we got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one representative of each powerful group.</p>
<p>公立学校的教科书是各种权力群体希望孩子被告知的内容之间的妥协。谎言很少是直白的。通常要么是遗漏，要么是过分强调某些话题而忽略其他。我们在小学学到的历史观是粗糙的圣徒传，每个权力群体至少有一个代表。</p>
<p>The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and George Washington Carver. Einstein was a big deal because his work led to the atom bomb. Marie Curie was involved with X-rays. But I was mystified about Carver. He seemed to have done stuff with peanuts.</p>
<p>我记得的著名科学家有爱因斯坦、玛丽・居里和乔治・华盛顿・卡佛。爱因斯坦很重要，因为他的工作促成了原子弹的诞生。玛丽・居里与 X 射线有关。但我对卡佛感到困惑，他似乎在花生上做了些研究。</p>
<p>It’s obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman), but as a kid I was confused for years about him. I wonder if it wouldn’t have been better just to tell us the truth: that there weren’t any famous black scientists. Ranking George Washington Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about the obstacles blacks faced in his time.</p>
<p>现在很明显，他能上榜是因为他是黑人（玛丽・居里能上榜是因为她是女性），但小时候，我多年来一直对他感到困惑。我想，或许直接告诉我们真相会更好：当时没有著名的黑人科学家。把乔治・华盛顿・卡佛与爱因斯坦相提并论，不仅误导了我们对科学的认知，也误导了我们对他那个时代黑人所面临的障碍的认知。</p>
<p>As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent. By the time you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was pretty much pure propaganda. For example, we were taught to regard political leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred Kennedy and King. It was astonishing to learn later that they’d both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to boot. (By the time King’s plagiarism emerged, I’d lost the ability to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)</p>
<p>学科越 “软”，谎言就越多。到了政治和近代史，我们学到的几乎全是宣传。例如，我们被教导要把政治领袖视为圣人 —— 尤其是最近被暗杀的肯尼迪和金。后来得知他们都是连环花花公子，肯尼迪还是个安非他命成瘾者，真是令人震惊。（当金的剽窃行为曝光时，我已经对名人的恶行不再感到惊讶了。）</p>
<p>I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them lies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about it has some kind of spin to put on it. Much recent history consists of spin. It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts like that.</p>
<p>我怀疑，教孩子近代史不可能不撒谎，因为几乎每个对此有话可说的人，都想加入自己的偏见。很多近代史本身就是偏见。或许最好只是教他们诸如此类的 “元事实”。</p>
<p>Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way to succeed is through following “the rules.” In fact most such rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.</p>
<p>不过，学校里最大的谎言可能是：成功的途径是遵守 “规则”。事实上，大多数这样的规则只是为了高效管理大型群体而采取的权宜之计。</p>
<h3 id="Peace"><a href="#Peace" class="headerlink" title="Peace"></a><strong>Peace</strong></h3><p><strong>和谐</strong></p>
<p>Of all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probably the same mundane reason they lie to us.</p>
<p>在我们对孩子撒谎的所有原因中，最主要的可能和他们对我们撒谎的原因一样平凡。</p>
<p>Often when we lie to people it’s not part of any conscious strategy, but because they’d react violently to the truth. Kids, almost by definition, lack self-control. They react violently to things—and so they get lied to a lot. [9]</p>
<p>我们对别人撒谎，往往不是出于什么有意识的策略，而是因为他们会对真相做出激烈反应。孩子，几乎就定义而言，缺乏自控力。他们会对事情做出激烈反应 —— 所以他们经常被撒谎。[9]</p>
<p>A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie to kids. As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted to die. Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner. And that (phew) was the end of that.</p>
<p>几年前的一个感恩节，我的一个朋友遇到了一件事，完美诠释了我们对孩子撒谎时的复杂动机。当烤火鸡端上桌时，他那个异常敏锐的 5 岁儿子突然问：“这只火鸡愿意死吗？” 预见到灾难的朋友和妻子迅速编了个谎：“是的，这只火鸡愿意死，事实上，它一生的目标就是成为我们的感恩节晚餐。” 然后（呼），这事就过去了。</p>
<p>Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we’re usually also lying to keep the peace.</p>
<p>每当我们为了保护孩子而对他们撒谎时，通常也是为了维持和谐。</p>
<p>One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up thinking horrible things are normal. It’s hard for us to feel a sense of urgency as adults over something we’ve literally been trained not to worry about. When I was about 10 I saw a documentary on pollution that put me into a panic. It seemed the planet was being irretrievably ruined. I went to my mother afterward to ask if this was so. I don’t remember what she said, but she made me feel better, so I stopped worrying about it.</p>
<p>这种 “安抚性谎言” 的一个后果是，我们长大后会认为可怕的事情是正常的。我们很难像成年人那样对某件事感到紧迫，因为我们实际上被训练得不去担心它。我 10 岁左右时看了一部关于污染的纪录片，吓得惊慌失措。当时觉得地球正被不可挽回地破坏。后来我去找妈妈，问是不是这样。我不记得她说了什么，但她让我感觉好多了，所以我就不再担心了。</p>
<p>That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old. But we should understand the price. This sort of lie is one of the main reasons bad things persist: we’re all trained to ignore them.</p>
<p>这可能是处理一个受惊的 10 岁孩子的最佳方式。但我们应该明白其代价。这种谎言是很多坏事持续存在的主要原因之一：我们都被训练得去忽略它们。</p>
<h3 id="Detox"><a href="#Detox" class="headerlink" title="Detox"></a><strong>Detox</strong></h3><p><strong>解毒</strong></p>
<p>A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called “oxygen debt.” His body switches to an emergency source of energy that’s faster than regular aerobic respiration. But this process builds up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break down, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while to recover.</p>
<p>赛跑中的短跑运动员几乎会立即进入一种叫做 “氧债” 的状态。他的身体会切换到一种比常规有氧呼吸更快的应急能量来源。但这个过程会产生废物，最终需要额外的氧气来分解，所以比赛结束后，他必须停下来喘一会儿气才能恢复。</p>
<p>We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt. We were told a lot of lies to get us (and our parents) through our childhood. Some may have been necessary. Some probably weren’t. But we all arrive at adulthood with heads full of lies.</p>
<p>我们成年时，都背负着一种 “真相债”。为了让我们（和我们的父母）度过童年，我们被撒了很多谎。有些可能是必要的，有些可能不是。但我们所有人成年时，脑子里都塞满了谎言。</p>
<p>There’s never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all the lies they told you. They’ve forgotten most of them. So if you’re going to clear these lies out of your head, you’re going to have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>从来没有哪个时刻，成年人会坐下来向你解释他们对你撒的所有谎。他们已经忘记了大部分。所以，如果你想把这些谎言从脑子里清除出去，就必须自己动手。</p>
<p>Few do. Most people go through life with bits of packing material adhering to their minds and never know it. You probably never can completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but it’s worth trying. I’ve found that whenever I’ve been able to undo a lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.</p>
<p>很少有人会这么做。大多数人一生都带着脑子里的 “包装碎片”，却从未意识到。你可能永远无法完全消除小时候被灌输的谎言带来的影响，但值得一试。我发现，每当我能解开一个被告知的谎言时，很多其他事情都会豁然开朗。</p>
<p>Fortunately, once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new resource you can use to figure out what lies you were told. You’re now one of the liars. You get to watch behind the scenes as adults spin the world for the next generation of kids.</p>
<p>幸运的是，一旦成年，你就会获得一种宝贵的新资源，可以用来弄清楚自己小时候被撒了哪些谎。你现在成了撒谎者之一。你可以在幕后观察成年人如何为下一代孩子构建这个世界。</p>
<p>The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are from a neutral observer. When I left high school I was, I thought, a complete skeptic. I’d realized high school was crap. I thought I was ready to question everything I knew. But among the many other things I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in my head. It’s not enough to consider your mind a blank slate. You have to consciously erase it.</p>
<p>理清思路的第一步，是意识到自己离一个中立的观察者有多远。我高中毕业时，自认为是一个彻底的怀疑论者。我意识到高中很糟糕，以为自己已经准备好质疑所知道的一切。但我忽略了很多其他事情，包括我脑子里已经有了多少 “垃圾”。把自己的思想视为一张白纸是不够的，你必须有意识地去擦拭它。</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we think. If you look at what adults told children in the past, it’s shocking how much they lied to them. Like us, they did it with the best intentions. So if we think we’re as open as one could reasonably be with children, we’re probably fooling ourselves. Odds are people in 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we are at some of the lies people told 100 years ago.</p>
<p>[1] 我坚持用 “谎言” 这个极其简单的词，原因之一是我们对孩子撒的谎，可能并不像我们想的那么无害。看看过去的成年人对孩子说过什么，你会震惊于他们撒谎的程度。和我们一样，他们的初衷是好的。所以，如果我们觉得自己已经尽可能对孩子坦诚了，很可能是在自欺欺人。有很大概率，100 年后的人们会对我们现在撒的某些谎感到震惊，就像我们对 100 年前的人撒的某些谎感到震惊一样。</p>
<p>I can’t predict which these will be, and I don’t want to write an essay that will seem dumb in 100 years. So instead of using special euphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions, I’m just going to call all our lies lies.</p>
<p>我无法预测哪些谎言会是如此，也不想写一篇 100 年后会显得愚蠢的文章。所以，我不会用那些符合当下潮流、看似 “情有可原” 的委婉语来指代谎言，而是直接把所有谎言都称为 “谎言”。</p>
<p>(I have omitted one type: lies told to play games with kids’ credulity. These range from “make-believe,” which is not really a lie because it’s told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by older siblings. There’s not much to say about these: I wouldn’t want the first type to go away, and wouldn’t expect the second type to.)</p>
<p>（我省略了一种谎言：为了戏耍孩子的轻信而撒的谎。这类谎言范围很广，从 “假装游戏”（这其实不算真正的谎言，因为说的时候带着暗示）到年长的兄弟姐妹说的吓人谎言。关于这些，没太多好说的：我不希望第一种消失，也不指望第二种会消失。）</p>

<p>[3] If you ask parents why kids shouldn’t swear, the less educated ones usually reply with some question-begging answer like “it’s inappropriate,” while the more educated ones come up with elaborate rationalizations. In fact the less educated parents seem closer to the truth.</p>
<p>[3] 如果你问父母为什么孩子不能说脏话，教育程度较低的父母通常会给出一些循环论证的答案，比如 “这不合适”，而教育程度较高的父母则会想出复杂的合理化解释。事实上，教育程度较低的父母似乎更接近真相。</p>
<p>[4] As a friend with small children pointed out, it’s easy for small children to consider themselves immortal, because time seems to pass so slowly for them. To a 3 year old, a day feels like a month might to an adult. So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would to us.</p>
<p>[4] 正如一位有小孩的朋友指出的，小孩子很容易觉得自己是不朽的，因为对他们来说，时间过得太慢了。对一个 3 岁的孩子来说，一天的感觉就像成年人眼中的一个月。所以，80 年对他来说，就像 2400 年对我们来说一样漫长。</p>
<p>[5] I realize I’m going to get endless grief for classifying religion as a type of lie. Usually people skirt that issue with some equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual standards for truth. But because I can’t predict which lies future generations will consider inexcusable, I can’t safely omit any type we tell. Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it.</p>
<p>[5] 我知道，把宗教归为一种谎言会招来无尽的指责。通常人们会含糊其辞地回避这个问题，暗示只要足够多的人相信足够长时间的谎言，就可以不受常规真理标准的评判。但因为我无法预测未来世代会认为哪些谎言不可原谅，所以不能贸然省略我们说过的任何一种谎言。诚然，100 年后宗教可能依然流行，这看似合理，但这并不比 1880 年的人预测 1980 年的学童会被教导 “自慰完全正常，不必为此内疚” 更不合理。</p>
<p>[6] Unfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well as good ones. For example, there are certain qualities that some groups in America consider “acting white.” In fact most of them could as accurately be called “acting Japanese.” There’s nothing specifically white about such customs. They’re common to all cultures with long traditions of living in cities. So it is probably a losing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as part of its identity.</p>
<p>[6] 不幸的是，这种 “承载的内容” 既可能包含好习俗，也可能包含坏习俗。例如，美国有些群体认为某些品质是 “装白人”。事实上，这些品质更准确地说应该是 “装日本人”。这类习俗并非白人所特有，而是所有有着悠久城市生活传统的文化所共有的。所以，一个群体把与之相反的行为当作自身身份的一部分，很可能是个失败的赌注。</p>
<p>[7] In this context, “issues” basically means “things we’re going to lie to them about.” That’s why there’s a special name for these topics.</p>
<p>[7] 在这种语境下，“议题”（issues）本质上就是 “我们要对他们撒谎的事情”。这就是为什么这些话题有专门的名称。</p>

<p>[9] The ironic thing is, this is also the main reason kids lie to adults. If you freak out when people tell you alarming things, they won’t tell you them. Teenagers don’t tell their parents what happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend’s house for the same reason parents don’t tell 5 year olds the truth about the Thanksgiving turkey. They’d freak if they knew.</p>
<p>[9] 讽刺的是，这也是孩子对成年人撒谎的主要原因。如果你听到惊人的消息就反应激烈，别人就不会告诉你了。青少年不告诉父母他们本应在朋友家过夜的那晚发生了什么，和父母不告诉 5 岁孩子感恩节火鸡的真相，原因是一样的：怕他们知道后反应激烈。</p>
