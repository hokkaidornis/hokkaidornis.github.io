<p>March 2005</p>
<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer Society.)<br>（本文改编自哈佛大学计算机学会的一次演讲。）</p>
<p>You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.<br>要创办一家成功的初创公司，你需要三样东西：从优秀的人开始，做出客户真正想要的产品，以及尽可能少花钱。大多数初创公司失败，都是因为在这三点中的某一点上出了问题。做到这三点的初创公司，大概率会成功。</p>
<p>And that’s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.<br>仔细想想，这其实挺令人兴奋的，因为这三件事都是可以做到的。难，但并非做不到。而且，成功的初创公司通常会让创始人变得富有，这意味着 “变富” 也是可以做到的。难，但并非做不到。</p>
<p>If there is one message I’d like to get across about startups, that’s it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.<br>如果说关于初创公司我想传达一个核心信息，那就是：没有哪一步需要天才般的智慧才能跨越，不存在那种 “神奇的难点”。</p>
<h3 id="The-Idea"><a href="#The-Idea" class="headerlink" title="The Idea"></a><strong>The Idea</strong></h3><p><strong>创意</strong></p>
<p>In particular, you don’t need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn’t take brilliance to do better.<br>尤其要说明的是，创办初创公司并不需要一个天才般的创意。初创公司赚钱的方式，是为人们提供比现有技术更好的东西。但现在人们使用的东西往往糟糕透顶，想要做得更好，并不需要多么聪明。</p>
<p>Google’s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn’t suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]<br>比如，谷歌的计划很简单：做一个不烂的搜索引擎。他们有三个新想法：索引更多的网页，用链接来给搜索结果排序，以及做出简洁干净的网页，配上不刺眼的关键词广告。最重要的是，他们决心做一个好用的网站。毫无疑问，谷歌内部有很多厉害的技术技巧，但整体计划其实很直接。即便他们现在的野心可能更大了，但仅凭这一点，每年就能带来十亿美元的收入。[1]</p>
<p>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn’t suck.<br>还有很多领域，就像谷歌出现之前的搜索领域一样落后。我能想到几个催生初创公司创意的方法，但大多可以归结为：看看人们在尝试做什么，然后想办法把这件事做得不那么烂。</p>
<p>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And yet there’s a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.<br>比如，现在的交友网站比谷歌出现前的搜索引擎烂多了。它们都在用同样简单粗暴的模式。它们似乎是从 “如何做数据库匹配” 的角度来解决问题，而不是考虑现实中约会是如何运作的。一个本科生做课程作业都能做出更好的东西。但这个领域涉及的资金却很多。在线约会现在已经是一门值钱的生意了，如果真能做好，它的价值可能会翻上一百倍。</p>
<p>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you’ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.<br>然而，初创公司的创意仅仅是个开始。很多想成为创始人的人认为，整个过程的关键是最初的创意，之后只需要执行就行。但风险投资家们更清楚。如果你带着一个 “天才创意” 去找风投，说只要他们签了保密协议就告诉他们，大多数风投会让你走开。这足以说明一个单纯的创意值多少钱 —— 它的市场价值还比不上签保密协议的麻烦。</p>
<p>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft’s original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn’t occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.<br>很多初创公司在发展过程中会改变计划，这也说明最初的创意没那么重要。微软最初的计划，竟然是靠卖编程语言赚钱。五年后，IBM 把现在的商业模式送到他们面前，他们才想到可以这么做。</p>
<p>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they’re not transferrable. They’re not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.<br>当然，初创公司的创意是有价值的，但问题在于，它们无法转移。你不能把创意交给别人去执行。它们的价值主要在于作为起点 —— 是让想出创意的人继续思考的问题。</p>
<p>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can’t save bad people.<br>重要的不是创意，而是拥有创意的人。优秀的人能修正糟糕的创意，但优秀的创意救不了糟糕的人。</p>
<h3 id="People"><a href="#People" class="headerlink" title="People"></a><strong>People</strong></h3><p><strong>团队成员</strong></p>
<p>What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.<br>我说的 “优秀的人” 是什么意思？在我们创办公司的过程中，我学到的一个最好的招聘技巧是：你能说这个人是个 “疯子” 吗？这个词可能很难翻译成其他语言，但美国人大概都懂它的意思。它指的是那种对工作过于认真的人；那种把事情做得极好，超越了 “专业”，达到 “痴迷” 程度的人。</p>
<p>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won’t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.<br>具体来说，这因工作而异：一个绝不接受 “不” 的销售人员；一个宁愿熬夜到凌晨四点，也不愿带着代码里的 bug 上床睡觉的程序员；一个会给《纽约时报》记者打陌生电话的公关；一个看到东西偏离两毫米就会觉得生理不适的平面设计师。</p>
<p>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they’d signed up.<br>我们公司几乎每个人在自己的领域都是这样的 “疯子”。负责销售的女士非常执着，我都常常为和她通电话的潜在客户感到同情。你能感觉到他们在电话那头坐立不安，但你知道，不签单他们是不会得到安宁的。</p>
<p>If you think about people you know, you’ll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person’s image to mind and imagine the sentence “so-and-so is an animal.” If you laugh, they’re not. You don’t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.<br>想想你认识的人，你会发现这个 “疯子测试” 很好用。在脑海中浮现一个人的样子，然后默念 “某某是个疯子”。如果你笑了，那他就不是。大公司里可能不需要这种特质，甚至不想要，但初创公司需要。</p>
<p>For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around?<br>对于程序员，我们还有三个额外的测试：这个人是真的聪明吗？如果是，他真的能把事情做成吗？最后，因为有些优秀的程序员性格让人难以忍受，我们能忍受和他共事吗？</p>
<p>That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn’t stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren’t truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.<br>最后一个测试筛掉的人少得惊人。如果一个人真的聪明，我们能忍受他任何程度的 “书呆子气”。我们受不了的是那些态度傲慢的人。但大多数态度傲慢的人并不真的聪明，所以第三个测试在很大程度上是第一个测试的重申。</p>
<p>When nerds are unbearable it’s usually because they’re trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like “I don’t know,” “Maybe you’re right,” and “I don’t understand x well enough.”<br>书呆子让人受不了，通常是因为他们太努力想显得聪明。但一个人越聪明，就越不会有 “必须表现得聪明” 的压力。所以，通常来说，真正聪明的人会说 “我不知道”“也许你是对的”“我对 x 了解得不够”—— 从这些话里你能认出他们。</p>
<p>This technique doesn’t always work, because people can be influenced by their environment. In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I’m told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager. Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.<br>但这个方法并不总是管用，因为人会受环境影响。麻省理工学院计算机系似乎有个传统：表现得粗鲁又自以为什么都懂。有人说这源于马文・明斯基，就像经典的飞行员做派据说源于查克・耶格尔一样。在那里，即使是真正聪明的人也会开始这么做，所以你得有所体谅。</p>
<p>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say “I don’t know” of anyone I’ve met. (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.) No one dared put on attitude around Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.<br>罗伯特・莫里斯对我们帮助很大，他是我见过的最愿意说 “我不知道” 的人之一（至少在他成为麻省理工学院教授之前是这样）。在罗伯特身边，没人敢摆架子，因为他显然比所有人都聪明，却毫无傲慢之气。</p>
<p>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. [2]<br>和大多数初创公司一样，我们也是从一群朋友开始的，我们雇佣的大多数人都是通过私人关系找到的。这是初创公司和大公司的一个关键区别。和一个人做几天朋友，你对他的了解，比公司通过面试能了解到的要多得多。[2]</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that’s where smart people meet. It’s not what people learn in classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them. They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.<br>初创公司多在大学周边诞生，这并非巧合，因为那里是聪明人聚集的地方。麻省理工和斯坦福周边涌现出很多科技公司，不是因为人们在课堂上学到了什么。就算课堂上唱篝火歌，只要招生标准不变，这些公司还是会出现。</p>
<p>If you start a startup, there’s a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school. So in theory you ought to try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right? Well, no. Don’t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn’t work well with hackers.<br>如果你要创办初创公司，很可能是和大学里或研究生院认识的人一起。所以理论上，你在学校里应该尽量多和聪明人交朋友，对吗？不对。不要刻意去套近乎，这对程序员没用。</p>
<p>What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don’t plan to start startups, because it’s the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn’t aim too directly at either target. Don’t force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.<br>你在大学里应该做的是自己的项目。即使不打算创办初创公司，程序员也应该这么做，因为这是学习编程的唯一真正途径。有时候你可能会和其他学生合作，这是认识优秀程序员的最好方式。这个项目甚至可能发展成一家初创公司。但再次强调，不要太直接地盯着这两个目标。不要勉强，就和你喜欢的人一起做你喜欢的事就好。</p>
<p>Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don’t want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo. Partly because you don’t need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you’ll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish. If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions. You don’t want mere voting; you need unanimity.<br>理想情况下，创始人数量在 2 到 4 人之间。一个人很难启动。一个人会觉得创办公司的精神压力难以承受。即使是比尔・盖茨 —— 他似乎能承受很大的精神压力 —— 也需要一个联合创始人。但创始人也不能太多，否则公司就像一张集体照了。部分原因是一开始不需要那么多人，更主要的是，创始人越多，分歧就越严重。如果只有两三个创始人，你知道必须立即解决争端，否则公司就完了。如果有七八个人，分歧可能会拖延，甚至固化成派系。你不需要简单的投票，你需要的是全体一致。</p>
<p>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people. During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them. This doesn’t work well. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don’t know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business people try to hire hackers, they can’t tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it’s roulette.<br>大多数初创公司都是科技公司，这类公司的创始人中应该有技术人员。互联网泡沫时期，有很多初创公司是由商人创办的，然后他们再去找程序员来为他们开发产品。这行不通。商人不擅长决定如何利用技术，因为他们不知道有哪些选择，也不知道哪些问题难、哪些问题容易。而且商人招聘程序员时，分不清谁是优秀的。即使是其他程序员，也很难做到这一点。对商人来说，这就像轮盘赌。</p>
<p>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called “business” if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It’s not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.<br>初创公司的创始人必须包括商人吗？这要看情况。我们创办公司时是这么想的，我们问了几个据说懂 “商业” 这个神秘东西的人，问他们愿不愿意当总裁。但他们都拒绝了，所以我不得不自己来。然后我发现，商业没什么神秘的。它不像物理或医学那样需要深入研究。你只需要想办法让人们为你的东西付钱。</p>
<p>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers’ mundane problems. People who don’t want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this. By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math. Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same trick to some degree.<br>我之所以觉得商业很神秘，我想是因为我厌恶做商业相关的事。我想在纯粹的、智力层面的软件世界里工作，不想处理客户那些琐碎的问题。不想被某种工作拖累的人，往往会故意表现得做不好这件事。保罗・埃尔德什就很擅长这一点。他看起来连半个葡萄柚都切不了（更别说去商店买了），这样就迫使别人为他做这些事，让他有更多时间研究数学。埃尔德什是个极端案例，但大多数丈夫在某种程度上也会用这招。</p>
<p>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don’t need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.<br>一旦我被迫放下这种 “故意无能”，我发现商业既不像我担心的那么难，也不像我担心的那么无聊。商业中有些深奥的领域确实很难，比如税法或衍生品定价，但初创公司不需要了解这些。运营初创公司所需的商业知识，都是商学院甚至大学出现之前人们就知道的常识。</p>
<p>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you’ll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don’t hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you’d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]<br>如果你浏览《福布斯》400 富豪榜，在每个有 MBA 学位的人名字旁打个叉，你会对商学院有个重要发现。在沃伦・巴菲特之后，直到第 22 位耐克 CEO 菲尔・奈特，你才会看到另一个 MBA。前 50 名中只有 5 个 MBA。《福布斯》400 富豪榜中，很多人都有技术背景：比尔・盖茨、史蒂夫・乔布斯、拉里・埃里森、迈克尔・戴尔、杰夫・贝佐斯、戈登・摩尔。科技行业的领军者往往来自技术领域，而非商业领域。所以，如果你想花两年时间做一件有助于你在商业上成功的事，有证据表明，学编程比读 MBA 更好。[3]</p>
<p>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this– that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That’s nonsense. There’s nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.<br>不过，初创公司可能需要商人的一个原因是：至少要有一个人愿意且能够专注于客户想要什么。有些人认为只有商人能做到这一点 —— 程序员能开发软件，但不能设计软件。这是胡说八道。懂编程并不妨碍程序员理解用户，不懂编程也不会神奇地让商人理解用户。</p>
<p>If you can’t understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.<br>但如果你无法理解用户，你要么学着去理解，要么找一个能理解用户的联合创始人。这是科技初创公司最关键的问题，也是导致大多数公司失败的原因。</p>
<h3 id="What-Customers-Want"><a href="#What-Customers-Want" class="headerlink" title="What Customers Want"></a><strong>What Customers Want</strong></h3><p><strong>客户想要什么</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don’t give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?<br>不只是初创公司需要担心这个问题。我认为大多数失败的企业，都是因为没有给客户他们想要的东西。看看餐馆就知道了。很多餐馆会倒闭，第一年大约有四分之一。但你能想到哪家食物真的很棒的餐馆倒闭了吗？</p>
<p>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It’s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It’s more straightforward just to make the food good.<br>食物很棒的餐馆似乎无论如何都会兴旺。一家食物很棒的餐馆，就算价格贵、人多、嘈杂、肮脏、位置偏僻，甚至服务差，人们还是会源源不断地来。诚然，食物一般的餐馆有时能通过噱头吸引顾客。但这种方法风险很大。更直接的做法就是把食物做好。</p>
<p>It’s the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?<br>科技行业也是如此。你会听到各种各样初创公司失败的原因。但你能想到哪家公司的产品非常受欢迎，最后却失败了吗？</p>
<p>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn’t want the product. For most, the cause of death is listed as “ran out of funding,” but that’s only the immediate cause. Why couldn’t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.<br>几乎每一家失败的初创公司，真正的问题都是客户不想要他们的产品。大多数公司的 “死因” 被列为 “资金耗尽”，但这只是直接原因。他们为什么得不到更多资金？可能是因为产品很烂，或者看起来永远做不完，或者两者都有。</p>
<p>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that’s implicit in making something customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.<br>当我在思考初创公司需要做的事情时，我差点加上第四条：尽快推出第一个版本。但我决定不加，因为这是 “做出客户想要的产品” 的应有之义。做出客户想要的产品的唯一方法，是把原型放在他们面前，然后根据他们的反应进行改进。</p>
<p>The other approach is what I call the “Hail Mary” strategy. You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term “engineer” for hackers), and then find after a year that you’ve spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.<br>另一种方法我称之为 “孤注一掷” 策略。你为产品制定详尽的计划，雇佣一个工程师团队来开发（这样做的人往往用 “工程师” 来称呼程序员），然后一年后发现，你花了两百万美元开发出的东西没人想要。互联网泡沫时期，这种情况并不少见，尤其是在商人运营的公司里，他们认为软件开发很可怕，因此必须仔细规划。</p>
<p>We never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it’s certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.<br>我们从未考虑过这种方法。作为一个 Lisp 程序员，我来自快速原型开发的传统。我不会说（至少在这里不会）这是编写所有程序的正确方法，但对于初创公司的软件开发来说，这无疑是正确的方法。在初创公司，你的初始计划几乎肯定在某些方面是错误的，你的首要任务应该是找出错误在哪里。唯一的方法就是尝试去实现它们。</p>
<p>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn’t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them. We also thought we’d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.<br>和大多数初创公司一样，我们在过程中改变了计划。起初，我们以为客户会是网络顾问。但结果是他们不喜欢我们，因为我们的软件易用，而且我们提供托管服务。这样客户太容易解雇他们了。我们还以为能签下很多目录邮购公司，因为在线销售是他们现有业务的自然延伸。但在 1996 年，这很难推销。我们交谈过的目录邮购公司的中层管理者，不把网络视为机会，而视为会给他们增加更多工作的东西。</p>
<p>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick’s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.<br>我们确实签下了一些更大胆的目录邮购公司。其中包括好莱坞的弗雷德里克公司，这让我们获得了处理服务器高负载的宝贵经验。但我们的大多数用户是小型个体商户，他们把网络视为创业的机会。有些有实体店，但很多只在网上存在。于是我们改变方向，专注于这些用户。我们不再专注于网络顾问和目录邮购公司想要的功能，而是努力让软件更易用。</p>
<p>I learned something valuable from that. It’s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking’s editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you’re riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn’t just increase your sales 10%. It’s more likely to double your sales.<br>从中我学到了宝贵的一课：让技术易用是非常值得努力的。程序员太习惯电脑了，他们根本不知道软件在普通人看来有多可怕。史蒂芬・霍金的编辑告诉他，书中每多一个公式，销量就会减半。当你努力让技术更易用时，你是在顺应上升的曲线，而不是下降的。易用性提升 10%，带来的不仅仅是 10% 的销量增长，更可能让销量翻倍。</p>
<p>How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn’t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn’t just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.<br>如何弄清楚客户想要什么？观察他们。最好的地方之一是行业展会。行业展会作为获取新客户的方式并不划算，但作为市场调研是值得的。我们在展会上不只是做千篇一律的演示，而是向人们展示如何搭建真实可用的商店。这意味着我们可以观察他们使用我们的软件，并和他们谈论他们的需求。</p>
<p>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you’re developing technology for money, you’re probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?<br>无论你创办什么样的初创公司，作为创始人，理解用户的需求可能都需要费点劲。唯一不需要研究用户就能开发的软件，是那种你自己就是典型用户的软件。但这类软件往往是开源的：操作系统、编程语言、编辑器等等。所以，如果你开发技术是为了赚钱，你开发的对象很可能不是和你一样的人。事实上，你可以用这种方式来产生初创公司的创意：那些和你不一样的人，想从技术中得到什么？</p>
<p>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they’re big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you’ll start one of those.<br>大多数人想到初创公司时，会想到苹果或谷歌这样的公司。每个人都知道它们，因为它们是大型消费品牌。但每有一家这样的公司，就有二十多家在细分市场运营，或者在基础设施领域默默存在。所以，如果你创办了一家成功的初创公司，很可能是后者中的一员。</p>
<p>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.<br>换句话说，如果你想创办那种必须成为大型消费品牌的初创公司，失败的几率会更高。最好的机会在细分市场。因为初创公司通过提供比现有更好的东西来赚钱，所以最糟糕的地方往往蕴藏着最好的机会。而企业 IT 部门的情况可能是最糟糕的。你很难相信公司在软件上花了多少钱，却只得到一堆垃圾。这种不平衡就是机会。</p>
<p>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.<br>如果你想为初创公司寻找创意，最有价值的做法之一是找一家中型非科技公司，花几周时间观察他们如何使用电脑。大多数优秀的程序员对这些地方的糟糕情况一无所知，就像美国富人不知道巴西贫民窟里发生了什么一样。</p>
<p>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it’s easier to sell to them. It’s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can’t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers. [4]<br>先为小公司开发软件，因为卖给他们更容易。向大公司推销东西的价值太大了，以至于那些向他们推销现有垃圾软件的人会花大量时间和金钱去做。虽然你闭着眼睛都能在技术上打败甲骨文，但你赢不过甲骨文的销售人员。所以，如果你想通过更好的技术获胜，把目标对准小客户。[4]</p>
<p>They’re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It’s easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper. So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a room, they squash the “high-end” products against the ceiling. Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun. Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker. Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals. Avid did it to the manufacturers of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid. Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded him. If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you’ll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you’ll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.<br>无论如何，小客户是市场中更具战略价值的部分。在技术领域，低端市场总会吞噬高端市场。让廉价产品变得更强大，比让强大的产品变得更便宜更容易。所以，那些一开始是廉价、简单的产品，往往会逐渐变得更强大，就像房间里不断上涨的水，把 “高端” 产品挤到天花板上。太阳微系统公司对大型机做了这件事，英特尔正在对太阳微系统公司做这件事。微软 Word 对 Interleaf 和 Framemaker 等桌面出版软件做了这件事。大众市场的数码相机正在对专业级昂贵相机做这件事。Avid 对专业视频编辑系统制造商做了这件事，现在苹果正在对 Avid 做这件事。亨利・福特对他之前的汽车制造商做了这件事。如果你打造简单、廉价的产品，不仅一开始更容易销售，还能处于征服其余市场的最佳位置。</p>
<p>It’s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you’ll own the low end. And if you don’t, you’re in the crosshairs of whoever does.<br>让任何人在你之下发展都是很危险的。如果你有最便宜、最易用的产品，你就会占据低端市场。如果没有，你就会成为占据低端市场的人的目标。</p>
<h3 id="Raising-Money"><a href="#Raising-Money" class="headerlink" title="Raising Money"></a><strong>Raising Money</strong></h3><p><strong>融资</strong></p>
<p>To make all this happen, you’re going to need money. Some startups have been self-funding– Microsoft for example– but most aren’t. I think it’s wise to take money from investors. To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it’s hard to switch from that to a product company.<br>要实现这一切，你需要钱。有些初创公司是自筹资金的 —— 比如微软 —— 但大多数不是。我认为接受投资者的资金是明智的。要自筹资金，你必须从咨询公司做起，而从咨询公司转型为产品公司很难。</p>
<p>Financially, a startup is like a pass&#x2F;fail course. The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company’s chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it’s probably a smart move.<br>从财务角度看，初创公司就像一门只有通过或不及格的课程。从初创公司中致富的方法，是最大化公司成功的几率，而不是最大化你持有的股票数量。所以，如果你能用股票换取能提高成功几率的东西，这很可能是明智之举。</p>
<p>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process. Actually it’s merely tedious. I’ll try to give an outline of how it works.<br>对大多数程序员来说，找投资者似乎是一个可怕又神秘的过程。其实只是很繁琐。我会试着概述一下这个过程。</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy– at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.<br>你首先需要几万美元来支付开发原型期间的费用。这被称为种子资金。因为涉及的资金很少，筹集种子资金相对容易 —— 至少能很快得到同意或拒绝的答复。</p>
<p>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called “angels.” Often they’re people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don’t expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they’re supposed to decide quickly. It’s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.<br>通常，你从被称为 “天使投资者” 的富有的个人那里获得种子资金。他们往往是靠技术致富的人。在种子阶段，投资者不期望你有详尽的商业计划。大多数人知道他们应该快速做出决定。基于半页纸的协议，一周内拿到支票并不罕见。</p>
<p>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money. He’s a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company. Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.<br>我们创办 Viaweb 时，从朋友朱利安那里获得了 1 万美元的种子资金。但他给我们的远不止钱。他曾是 CEO，也是公司律师，所以给了我们很多宝贵的商业建议，还为我们公司的成立做了所有法律工作。此外，他还把我们介绍给了下一轮融资的两位天使投资者之一。</p>
<p>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do. But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.<br>有些天使投资者，尤其是有技术背景的，可能看了演示、听了你的口头计划就满意了。但很多人会想要一份商业计划，至少是为了提醒自己投资了什么。</p>
<p>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I’m amazed how much worry it caused me. “Business plan” has that word “business” in it, so I figured it had to be something I’d have to read a book about business plans to write. Well, it doesn’t. At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you’re going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders. If you just sit down and write out what you’ve been saying to one another, that should be fine. It shouldn’t take more than a couple hours, and you’ll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.<br>我们的天使投资者也要求一份，现在回想起来，我很惊讶这给我带来了那么多烦恼。“商业计划” 里有 “商业” 这个词，所以我以为必须读一本关于商业计划的书才能写。其实不用。在这个阶段，大多数投资者只希望看到你计划做什么、如何从中赚钱的简要描述，以及创始人的简历。如果你坐下来，把你们互相说过的话写下来，应该就可以了。这不会超过几个小时，而且你可能会发现，把这些写下来能让你产生更多想法。</p>
<p>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you’re going to have to have some kind of company. Merely incorporating yourselves isn’t hard. The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have. If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that’s easy. But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard. And once you’ve done it, it tends to be set in stone.<br>为了让天使投资者有一个可以开支票的对象，你需要成立某种形式的公司。仅仅注册公司并不难。问题是，公司要成立，你必须确定创始人是谁，以及每个人持有多少股份。如果有两个资历相同、对业务投入程度相同的创始人，这很简单。但如果有几个人，预计贡献程度不同，确定股份比例就会很难。而且一旦确定，往往就一成不变了。</p>
<p>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem. All I can say is, try hard to do it right. I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though. When everyone feels they’re getting a slightly bad deal, that they’re doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.<br>对于这个问题，我没有什么诀窍。我只能说，努力把它做好。不过，我有一个经验法则可以判断是否做得好：当每个人都觉得自己有点吃亏，觉得自己的付出比所持股份应得的要多时，股份分配就是最优的。</p>
<p>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, various things with the IRS. I’m not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that. When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything retroactively. It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don’t do everything you’re supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]<br>当然，成立公司不止注册这么简单：保险、营业执照、失业保险、国税局的各种事务。我甚至不确定清单上有什么，因为我们…… 跳过了所有这些。1996 年底我们获得真正的资金后，雇了一位很棒的首席财务官，他 retroactive 地处理了所有事情。事实证明，如果你在创办公司时没有做所有该做的事，不会有人来逮捕你。这也是件好事，否则很多初创公司永远都开不起来。[5]</p>
<p>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start another company doing the same thing. This does happen. So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone’s ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone’s only job.<br>推迟成立公司可能很危险，因为一个或多个创始人可能会决定分出去，创办一家做同样事情的公司。这种情况确实会发生。所以，在成立公司时，除了分配股份，你还应该让所有创始人签署协议，同意每个人的创意都属于这家公司，并且这家公司是每个人唯一的工作。</p>
<p>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]<br>（如果这是一部电影，这里应该响起不祥的音乐。）</p>
<p>While you’re at it, you should ask what else they’ve signed. One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.<br>在这个过程中，你应该问问他们还签过什么其他协议。初创公司可能遇到的最糟糕的事情之一，就是知识产权问题。我们遇到过，这比任何竞争对手都更接近让我们倒闭。</p>
<p>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we’d been about to be acquired, we’d allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it’s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can’t judge how serious it is.<br>就在我们即将被收购时，我们发现我们的一个员工早年签过一份协议，协议规定他所有的创意都属于那家资助他读研究生的大公司。理论上，这可能意味着我们的软件有很大一部分属于别人。所以收购戛然而止，我们努力解决这个问题。问题是，因为我们即将被收购，现金已经所剩无几。现在我们需要筹集更多资金来维持运营。但头上顶着知识产权的乌云，很难融到资，因为投资者无法判断问题的严重性。</p>
<p>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word “angel” is a metaphor. The founders thereupon proposed to walk away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves. And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on the deal.<br>我们现有的投资者知道我们需要钱，而且无处可寻，在这一点上尝试了一些策略，我不会详细描述，只是想提醒读者，“天使” 这个词是个比喻。于是，创始人提议离开公司，在那之前给投资者简单指导了一下如何自己管理服务器。就在这时，收购方以拖延为借口，拒绝履行协议。</p>
<p>Miraculously it all turned out ok. The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn’t own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay. So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off my life.<br>奇迹般地，一切都好了起来。投资者退缩了；我们以合理的估值进行了另一轮融资；那家大公司最终给了我们一份文件，说他们不拥有我们的软件；六个月后，我们被雅虎收购，价格比之前的收购方同意支付的要高得多。所以最后我们很高兴，尽管这段经历可能让我少活了这段经历可能让我少活了好几年。</p>
<p>Don’t do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.<br>不要做我们做过的事。在正式创办初创公司之前，问问每个人以前的知识产权相关经历。</p>
<p>Once you’ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas. But when you look at it from the rich people’s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments. If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you’re doing them a favor by letting them invest. Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?<br>一旦你成立了公司，去敲富人的门，要求他们投资几万美元给一群只有一些想法的人，可能会显得冒昧。但从富人的角度来看，情况更令人鼓舞。大多数富人都在寻找好的投资项目。如果你真的认为自己有成功的机会，让他们投资其实是在帮他们的忙。他们在被打扰时可能会感到烦恼，但同时也会想：这些人会是下一个谷歌吗？</p>
<p>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you’re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number. If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you’ve done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.<br>通常，天使投资者在财务上与创始人相当。他们获得相同类型的股票，在未来的融资轮次中被稀释的比例也相同。他们应该获得多少股份？这取决于你的野心有多大。当你用公司的 x% 换取 y 美元时，你含蓄地为整个公司赋予了一定的价值。风险投资通常用这个数字来描述。如果你以 10 万美元的价格向投资者发行相当于已发行股份 5% 的新股，那么这笔交易的投前估值是 200 万美元。</p>
<p>How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn’t realize that when we were raising money. Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one million, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]<br>你如何决定公司的价值？没有合理的方法。在这个阶段，公司只是一个赌注。我们融资时，我没有意识到这一点。朱利安认为我们应该给公司估值几百万美元。我认为，声称我们当时仅有的几千行代码值几百万美元，是荒谬的。最终我们定在了 100 万美元，因为朱利安说，没有人会投资估值更低的公司。[6]</p>
<p>What I didn’t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn’t just the value of the code we’d written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we’d do, which turned out to be a lot.<br>当时我没有意识到的是，估值不仅仅是我们到目前为止所写代码的价值。它还包括我们创意的价值（事实证明这些创意是正确的），以及我们未来所有工作的价值（事实证明有很多）。</p>
<p>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actual venture capital firms. But don’t wait till you’ve burned through your last round of funding to start approaching them. VCs are slow to make up their minds. They can take months. You don’t want to be running out of money while you’re trying to negotiate with them.<br>下一轮融资可能会涉及真正的风险投资公司。但不要等到上一轮资金耗尽才开始接触他们。风投做决定很慢，可能需要几个月。你不想在与他们谈判时资金耗尽。</p>
<p>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels. The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually. So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.<br>从真正的风投公司那里获得资金，比从天使投资者那里获得资金更重要。涉及的资金数额更大，通常是数百万美元。所以交易需要更长时间，稀释你的股份更多，还会施加更苛刻的条件。</p>
<p>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background. Maybe in some cases this is true. And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok. Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company. So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated. We used to call these guys “newscasters,” because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn’t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.<br>有时风投会想安插一个他们自己选择的新 CEO。通常他们会说，你需要一个成熟、有经验、有商业背景的人。也许在某些情况下这是对的。但比尔・盖茨年轻、缺乏经验、没有商业背景，却做得很好。史蒂夫・乔布斯被一个成熟、有经验、有商业背景的人赶出了自己的公司，而那个人随后毁了公司。所以我认为，那些成熟、有经验、有商业背景的人可能被高估了。我们过去称这些人为 “新闻播音员”，因为他们发型整齐，声音低沉自信，但通常所知不多，只知道提词器上的内容。</p>
<p>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money. The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal. That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the company? That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex. We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology. The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn’t need any help with those.<br>我们和很多风投谈过，但最终我们的初创公司完全靠天使资金融资。主要原因是我们担心，知名风投公司会在交易中安插一个 “新闻播音员”。如果他满足于只和媒体打交道，也许还可以，但如果他想在公司运营中有发言权呢？那将导致灾难，因为我们的软件非常复杂。我们公司的整个模式是通过更好的技术获胜。战略决策大多是关于技术的决策，我们在这些方面不需要任何帮助。</p>
<p>This was also one reason we didn’t go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well. But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster– someone who, as they say, “can talk Wall Street’s language.”<br>这也是我们不上市的一个原因。1998 年，我们的首席财务官试图说服我上市。那时候，即使是狗粮门户网站也能上市，所以作为一家有真实产品和真实收入的公司，我们可能会表现不错。但我担心这意味着要请一个 “新闻播音员”—— 也就是他们所说的 “能说华尔街语言的人”。</p>
<p>I’m happy to see Google is bucking that trend. They didn’t talk Wall Street’s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn’t buy. And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They’ll pay attention next time. Wall Street learns new languages fast when money is involved.<br>我很高兴看到谷歌在逆势而为。他们 IPO 时没有说华尔街的语言，华尔街也不买账。现在华尔街正在集体自责。下次他们会注意的。涉及金钱时，华尔街学新语言很快。</p>
<p>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize. The reason is other VCs. I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it’s a seller’s market. Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.<br>与风投谈判时，你的筹码比你意识到的要多。原因是其他风投。我现在认识很多风投，和他们交谈时你会意识到，这是一个卖方市场。即使现在，也是资金太多，好交易太少。</p>
<p>VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you’ve never heard of. What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar. Most VCs will tell you that they don’t just provide money, but connections and advice. If you’re talking to Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true. But such advice and connections can come very expensive. And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber. A few steps down from the top you’re basically talking to bankers who’ve picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading Wired. (Does your product use XML?) So I’d advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections. Basically, a VC is a source of money. I’d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.<br>风投构成了一个金字塔。顶端是红杉资本、凯鹏华盈等知名公司，但在它们之下，有很多你从未听说过的公司。它们的共同点是，从它们那里得到的一美元就是一美元。大多数风投会告诉你，他们提供的不仅仅是资金，还有人脉和建议。如果你和维诺德・科斯拉、约翰・杜尔或迈克・莫里茨交谈，这是真的。但这样的建议和人脉可能非常昂贵。而且越往下，风投就越蠢。在顶端之下几步，你基本上是在和那些从《连线》杂志上学了几个新词汇的银行家交谈（你的产品用 XML 吗？）。所以我建议你对他们所说的经验和人脉持怀疑态度。基本上，风投就是资金来源。我倾向于选择那些能最快提供最多资金、附加条件最少的人。</p>
<p>You may wonder how much to tell VCs. And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors. I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either. After all, as most VCs say, they’re more interested in the people than the ideas. The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea. So as long as you seem like you know what you’re doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]<br>你可能想知道该告诉风投多少信息。你应该考虑这个问题，因为他们中的一些人有一天可能会投资你的竞争对手。我认为最好的办法是不要明显保密，但也不要告诉他们所有事情。毕竟，正如大多数风投所说，他们对人比对创意更感兴趣。他们想谈论你的创意，主要是为了评判你，而不是创意本身。所以，只要你看起来知道自己在做什么，你可能可以对他们隐瞒一些事情。[7]</p>
<p>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don’t want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, and b) if you seem impressive, they’ll be discouraged from investing in your competitors. The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don’t want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups to present to them.<br>尽可能多地和风投交谈，即使你不想要他们的钱，因为 a）他们可能是未来收购你的公司的董事会成员，b）如果你给他们留下深刻印象，他们就不太可能投资你的竞争对手。接触风投最有效的方式，尤其是如果你只想让他们了解你而不想要他们的钱，是参加偶尔为初创公司举办的、向他们展示的会议。</p>
<h3 id="Not-Spending-It"><a href="#Not-Spending-It" class="headerlink" title="Not Spending It"></a><strong>Not Spending It</strong></h3><p><strong>不花钱</strong></p>
<p>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it? Not spend it, that’s what. In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.<br>当你从投资者那里获得一笔真正的资金时，你应该怎么处理？答案是：不花。几乎每一家失败的初创公司，直接原因都是资金耗尽。通常背后有更深层次的问题。但即使是直接死因，也值得努力避免。</p>
<p>During the Bubble many startups tried to “get big fast.” Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast. But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.<br>互联网泡沫时期，很多初创公司试图 “快速做大”。理想情况下，这意味着快速获得大量客户。但这很容易滑向 “快速雇佣大量员工”。</p>
<p>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But even that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who’d spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi. Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.<br>在这两种情况中，快速获得大量客户当然更可取。但即便如此，这也可能被高估了。其理念是先到先得，抢占所有用户，不给竞争对手留下任何空间。但我认为，在大多数行业中，率先进入市场的优势并没有那么巨大。谷歌又是一个例子。当谷歌出现时，搜索似乎是一个成熟的市场，由雅虎、莱科斯、Excite、Infoseek、Altavista、Inktomi 等大公司主导，它们花了数百万美元打造品牌。1998 年进入这个市场，显然有点晚了。</p>
<p>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you. As if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising. They’re like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.<br>但谷歌的创始人知道，在搜索业务中，品牌几乎一文不值。你可以在任何时候出现，做出更好的东西，用户会逐渐向你转移。似乎是为了强调这一点，谷歌从未做过任何广告。他们就像经销商，卖东西，但自己不用。</p>
<p>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software. Future startups should learn from that mistake. Unless you’re in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated. The dating sites are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they’re ripe for the picking. (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell a company run by marketing guys.)<br>被谷歌击败的竞争对手，与其花数百万美元做广告，不如花在改进软件上。未来的初创公司应该从这个错误中吸取教训。除非你所在的市场，产品像香烟、伏特加或洗衣粉一样没有差异化，否则在品牌广告上花很多钱是有问题的。而几乎没有网络业务是如此没有差异化的。现在的交友网站正在进行大规模的广告宣传，这更证明它们已经成熟到可以被颠覆了。（fee, fie, fo, fum，我闻到了一家由营销人员运营的公司的味道。）</p>
<p>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing. The founders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn’t have the smoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you’d be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you’d be stupid to use anyone else’s software. Both statements were true, but that’s not the way to convince people.<br>环境迫使我们缓慢成长，现在回想起来，这是件好事。创始人都学会了做公司里的每一项工作。除了写软件，我还得做销售和客户支持。我不擅长销售。我很执着，但没有优秀销售人员的圆滑。我对潜在客户说：不在线销售是愚蠢的，在线销售却用别人的软件也是愚蠢的。这两句话都是真的，但这不是说服人的方式。</p>
<p>I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you’re growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they’ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they’ll pay you.<br>但我很擅长客户支持。想象一下，你和一个客户支持人员交谈，他不仅对产品了如指掌，如果有 bug，还会诚恳道歉，然后在你打电话的时候立即修复。客户喜欢我们。我们也喜欢他们，因为当你靠口碑缓慢成长时，你的第一批用户是那些足够聪明、能自己找到你的人。在初创公司的早期阶段，没有什么比聪明的用户更有价值了。如果你听他们的，他们会准确地告诉你如何做出一款成功的产品。而且他们不仅会免费给你建议，还会付钱给你。</p>
<p>We officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users. Since this was the era of “get big fast,” I worried about how small and obscure we were. But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software. By the end of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.<br>我们在 1996 年初正式推出产品。到年底，我们大约有 70 个用户。因为那是 “快速做大” 的时代，我担心我们太小、太不起眼。但事实上，我们做的是完全正确的事。一旦你做大了（无论是用户还是员工数量），就很难改变你的产品了。那一年实际上是我们改进软件的实验室。到年底，我们已经远远领先于竞争对手，他们再也没有机会赶上我们了。而且，由于所有程序员都花了很多时间与用户交谈，我们比任何人都更了解电子商务。</p>
<p>That’s the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding your business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far from it. Google’s secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn’t understand search. I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere “search engine.” Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month’s growth, and now that we were established as a “media company,” or “portal,” or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.<br>这是初创公司成功的关键。没有什么比理解你的业务更重要的了。你可能认为，从事一项业务的人必然会理解它。远非如此。谷歌的秘密武器很简单，就是他们理解搜索。谷歌出现时我在雅虎工作，雅虎不理解搜索。我知道这一点，因为我曾经试图说服掌权者，我们必须改进搜索，但得到的答复是当时的官方说法：雅虎不再仅仅是一个 “搜索引擎”。搜索现在只占我们页面浏览量的一小部分，还不到一个月的增长，现在我们已经成为一家 “媒体公司” 或 “门户网站” 之类的，搜索可以像脐带一样安全地枯萎脱落。</p>
<p>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions start with. I think Yahoo gets that now.<br>好吧，搜索可能只占一小部分页面浏览量，但它们是重要的一部分，因为它们是网络会话的起点。我想雅虎现在明白了。</p>
<p>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don’t. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren’t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads “if the people lead, the leaders will follow.” Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes “get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.” More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don’t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.<br>谷歌还理解一些大多数网络公司仍然不理解的事情。最重要的是，你应该把用户放在广告商之前，即使广告商在付费而用户没有。我最喜欢的一个保险杠贴纸写着：“如果人民带头，领导者就会跟随。” 用到网络上，这就变成了：“赢得所有用户，广告商就会跟随。” 更一般地说，先设计产品取悦用户，然后再考虑如何从中赚钱。如果你不把用户放在首位，就会给那些这样做的竞争对手留下可乘之机。</p>
<p>To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say “get big slow.” The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.<br>要做出用户喜欢的东西，你必须理解他们。而且公司越大，理解他们就越难。所以我说 “缓慢做大”。你花光资金的速度越慢，你学习的时间就越多。</p>
<p>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That’s something Yahoo did understand. David Filo’s title was “Chief Yahoo,” but he was proud that his unofficial title was “Cheap Yahoo.” Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives. I was impressed by that. Yahoo’s market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.<br>缓慢花钱的另一个原因是培养节俭的文化。这是雅虎确实理解的事情。大卫・费罗的头衔是 “雅虎首席”，但他很自豪自己的非官方头衔是 “吝啬的雅虎”。我们到雅虎后不久，收到了费罗的一封邮件，他一直在浏览我们的目录结构，问是否真的有必要把这么多数据存储在昂贵的 RAID 硬盘上。这给我留下了深刻印象。当时雅虎的市值已经有几十亿了，他们却还在担心浪费几 GB 的磁盘空间。</p>
<p>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It’s important to realize you’re not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn’t revenue. It’s money investors have given you in the hope you’ll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in the bank, you’re still poor.<br>当你从风投公司拿到几百万美元时，往往会觉得自己很富有。但重要的是要意识到，你并非如此。真正富有的公司是那些拥有高额收入的公司。这笔钱不是收入，而是投资者给你的，希望你能借此创造收入。所以，即便银行账户里有几百万，你依然是 “穷” 的。</p>
<p>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.<br>对大多数初创公司来说，模式应该是研究生式的，而非律师事务所式的。要追求酷炫且廉价，而非昂贵且浮夸。对我们而言，判断一家初创公司是否明白这一点，要看他们是否有埃罗椅。埃罗椅在互联网泡沫时期问世，在初创公司中非常流行。尤其是那种当时随处可见的情况：一群年轻人拿着风投的钱过家家。我们的办公椅便宜到扶手都掉了。当时这有点尴尬，但现在回想起来，办公室里那种研究生般的氛围，是我们在不知不觉中做对的另一件事。</p>
<p>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom. It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against cosmic rays. When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values. But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup. We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.<br>我们的办公室在哈佛广场一栋木质的三层公寓楼里。直到 20 世纪 70 年代，这里还是一套公寓，浴室里还留着一个带爪足的浴缸。这里以前的住户一定很古怪，因为墙上的很多缝隙里都塞满了铝箔，仿佛是为了防宇宙射线。当知名访客来见我们时，我们会为这种简陋的环境有点不好意思。但事实上，那个地方对初创公司来说再完美不过了。我们觉得自己是一群无畏的弱者，而非 corporate 里的刻板人士，而这正是你需要的精神。</p>
<p>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you’ve probably discovered if you’ve tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work? So why not make work more like home?<br>公寓也是开发软件的理想场所。格子间在这方面糟透了，如果你试过的话，大概已经发现了。你有没有注意到，在家编程比在公司容易得多？那为什么不把工作场所弄得更像家呢？</p>
<p>When you’re looking for space for a startup, don’t feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I’d advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?<br>为初创公司找场地时，不必觉得它必须看起来很 “专业”。专业意味着把工作做好，而不是有电梯和玻璃墙。我建议大多数初创公司一开始不要选 corporate 写字楼，租个公寓就好。在初创公司，你会想 “住” 在办公室里，那为什么不选一个设计初衷就是供人居住的地方当办公室呢？</p>
<p>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that’s a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you’ve lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.<br>除了更便宜、更适合工作外，公寓的位置往往比写字楼好。对初创公司来说，位置非常重要。提高 productivity 的关键是让人们晚饭后回到工作岗位。电话不再响起的那些时间，是完成工作的最佳时段。当一群员工一起出去吃晚饭，讨论想法，然后回到办公室去实现它们时，很棒的事情就会发生。所以你会想待在一个周围有很多餐馆的地方，而不是一个下午 6 点后就变成荒地的沉闷办公园区。一旦公司变成那种模式 —— 每个人都开车回郊区吃晚饭，不管多晚 —— 你就失去了极其宝贵的东西。如果你的公司一开始就是这种模式，那可就麻烦了。</p>
<p>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I’d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.<br>如果我现在要创办一家初创公司，只会考虑三个地方：红线附近的中央广场、哈佛广场或戴维斯广场（肯德尔太刻板了）；帕洛阿尔托的大学大道或加州大道；以及伯克利校园南北附近。这些是我知道的、氛围最适合的地方。</p>
<p>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone’s office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.<br>不花钱最重要的方法是不招人。我可能有点极端，但我认为招人是公司能做的最糟糕的事。首先，人力是经常性支出，这是最糟糕的一种。他们还会让你空间不够用，甚至可能搬到那种不酷的写字楼，这会让你的软件质量下降。但最糟糕的是，他们会拖慢你的速度：本来你探进别人办公室就能讨论一个想法，现在却需要八个人开个会来讨论。所以，能少招人就尽量少招。</p>
<p>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get “staffed up” as soon as possible, as if you couldn’t get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title. That’s big company thinking. Don’t hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you’d like to do but can’t.<br>互联网泡沫时期，很多初创公司的做法恰恰相反。他们想尽快 “配齐人员”，仿佛除非有对应头衔的人，否则什么事都做不成。这是大公司的思维。不要为了填补某个预设的组织结构图中的空缺而招人。招人的唯一理由是，有件你想做但做不了的事需要人来做。</p>
<p>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it? I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO. If you ever end up running a company, you’ll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have. This is their way of weighing you. It’s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they’re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it’s ten.<br>如果招不必要的人既费钱又拖慢进度，为什么几乎所有公司都这么做？我认为主要原因是，人们喜欢被很多人簇拥的感觉。这种弱点甚至会延伸到 CEO 身上。如果你最终经营一家公司，会发现人们最常问的问题是你有多少员工。这是他们衡量你的方式。不只是普通人会问，连记者也会。如果答案是 1000 人，他们会比听到 10 人时印象深刻得多。</p>
<p>This is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it’s the one with fewer employees that’s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered “twenty,” I could see them thinking that we didn’t count for much. I used to want to add “but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?”<br>这其实很荒谬。如果两家公司收入相同，员工更少的那家更令人印象深刻。以前人们问我们初创公司有多少人，我回答 “20 人” 时，能看出他们觉得我们没什么分量。我曾想补充一句：“但我们主要的竞争对手 —— 我们经常打败他们 —— 有 140 人，那我们能不能按这两个数字中更大的那个算？”</p>
<p>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive. Any of you who were nerds in high school know about this choice. Keep doing it when you start a company.<br>和办公场所一样，员工数量也是一个选择：是看起来厉害，还是真的厉害。高中时是书呆子的人都懂这种选择。创办公司时，也要坚持做对的选择。</p>
<h3 id="Should-You"><a href="#Should-You" class="headerlink" title="Should You?"></a><strong>Should You?</strong></h3><p><strong>你适合吗？</strong></p>
<p>But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it? If you are, is it worth it?<br>但你应该创办公司吗？你是适合做这件事的人吗？如果是，那值得吗？</p>
<p>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it. That’s the main reason I wrote this. There could be ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.<br>适合创办初创公司的人，比他们自己意识到的要多。这是我写这篇文章的主要原因。初创公司的数量本可以是现在的十倍，而这很可能是件好事。</p>
<p>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a startup. But the idea terrified me at first. I was forced into it because I was a Lisp hacker. The company I’d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there were not a lot of other companies using Lisp. Since I couldn’t bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when “another language” meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.<br>我现在意识到，我正是那种适合创办初创公司的人。但一开始，这个想法让我很害怕。我是被迫走上这条路的，因为我是一个 Lisp 程序员。我之前做咨询的公司似乎遇到了麻烦，而其他用 Lisp 的公司不多。由于我无法忍受用其他语言编程（记住，那是 1995 年，“其他语言” 指的是 C++），似乎唯一的选择就是创办一家用 Lisp 的新公司。</p>
<p>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you’re a Lisp hacker you’ll know what I mean. And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too intimidated to try.<br>我知道这听起来有点牵强，但如果你是 Lisp 程序员，就会明白我的意思。如果连我都对创办初创公司如此恐惧，只是出于无奈才做，那肯定有很多人其实很适合，但因为胆怯而不敢尝试。</p>
<p>So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.<br>那么，谁应该创办初创公司呢？应该是这样的人：一个优秀的程序员，年龄在 23 到 38 岁左右，想一次性解决金钱问题，而不是在传统职业生涯中慢慢赚钱。</p>
<p>I can’t say precisely what a good hacker is. At a first rate university this might include the top half of computer science majors. Though of course you don’t have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.<br>我说不准优秀的程序员具体是什么样的。在顶尖大学，这可能包括计算机专业排名前半的学生。当然，你不一定非得是计算机专业的才能成为程序员；我大学学的是哲学。</p>
<p>It’s hard to tell whether you’re a good hacker, especially when you’re young. Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically. What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don’t these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z? And that’s also a sign that one is a good hacker.<br>很难判断自己是不是优秀的程序员，尤其是年轻时。幸运的是，创办初创公司的过程会自动筛选出这类人。促使人们创办初创公司的（或者说应该是），是看到现有技术时会想：这些人难道没意识到应该做 x、y、z 吗？而这也是优秀程序员的标志。</p>
<p>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there’s something that doesn’t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it’s like in an existing business before you try running your own. The business doesn’t have to be a startup. I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans. It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don’t have a lot of meetings; don’t have chunks of code that multiple people own; don’t have a sales guy running the company; don’t make a high-end product; don’t let your code get too big; don’t leave finding bugs to QA people; don’t go too long between releases; don’t isolate developers from users; don’t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it’s hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it’s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]<br>我把下限设在 23 岁，不是因为大脑到那时才发育完全，而是因为在尝试经营自己的公司之前，你需要了解现有企业是什么样的。这家企业不一定是初创公司。我曾在一家软件公司工作过一年，以还清大学贷款。那是我成年后最糟糕的一年，但当时我没有意识到，我学到了很多关于软件行业的宝贵经验。在这件事上，大多是反面教训：不要开太多会；不要让代码块被多个人 “拥有”；不要让销售来管理公司；不要做高端产品；不要让代码变得太大；不要把找 bug 的事留给 QA 人员；不要隔太久才发布一次；不要让开发者与用户隔绝；不要从剑桥搬到 128 号公路；等等。[8] 但反面教训和正面教训同样有价值。或许更有价值：重复一次精彩的表现很难，但避免错误却很简单。[9]</p>
<p>The other reason it’s hard to start a company before 23 is that people won’t take you seriously. VCs won’t trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you’re going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you’re very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you’ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you’re 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.<br>23 岁之前很难创办公司的另一个原因是，人们不会把你当回事。风投不会信任你，甚至会把让你当 “吉祥物” 作为投资条件。客户会担心你半途而废，让他们陷入困境。即使是你自己，除非你非常特别，否则多少会在意自己的年龄；你会觉得当比你大很多的人的老板很尴尬，而且如果你 21 岁，只招比你年轻的人会极大限制你的选择。</p>
<p>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft. (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you’re thinking, I don’t care what he says, I’m going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.<br>有些人如果愿意，18 岁可能就能创办公司。比尔・盖茨和保罗・艾伦创办微软时，盖茨 19 岁（不过艾伦 22 岁，这可能很重要）。所以如果你想：“不管他说什么，我现在就要创办公司”，那你可能是那种能成功的人。</p>
<p>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don’t think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don’t know if I could do that now.<br>另一个界限 38 岁，则有更多可弹性处理的空间。我把它设在那里的一个原因是，我认为很多人过了这个年龄，体力就跟不上了。我以前每周七天，每天都工作到凌晨两三点。现在我不知道自己还能不能做到。</p>
<p>Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can’t take so many risks– especially if you have kids.<br>此外，初创公司在财务上风险很大。如果你 26 岁时尝试创业失败，身无分文，没什么大不了的；很多 26 岁的人都没钱。到了 38 岁，你就不能冒这么多险了 —— 尤其是如果你有孩子的话。</p>
<p>My final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing– though in that case it probably won’t take four years.<br>我最后的测试可能是最严格的：你真的想创办初创公司吗？从经济角度来说，这相当于把你的职业生涯压缩到尽可能小的空间里。不是以普通节奏工作 40 年，而是拼命工作 4 年。而且可能最终一无所获 —— 不过那样的话，可能也用不了 4 年。</p>
<p>During this time you’ll do little but work, because when you’re not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend’s house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.<br>在这段时间里，你几乎只会工作，因为当你不工作时，你的竞争对手会在工作。我唯一的休闲活动是跑步（不管怎样，我需要跑步来保持工作状态），以及每晚大约 15 分钟的阅读。在那三年里，我交过一次女朋友，总共持续了两个月。每隔几周，我会抽出几个小时去旧书店，或者去朋友家吃晚饭。我去看望过家人两次。除此之外，我一直在工作。</p>
<p>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends. Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time. The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won’t try that again.<br>工作有时很有趣，因为和我一起工作的人是我最好的朋友中的几个。有时在技术上也很有趣。但这只占大约 10% 的时间。对于另外 90% 的时间，我能说的最好的是，其中一些现在回想起来比当时看起来更有趣。比如有一次，剑桥停电了大约六个小时，我们犯了个错误，试图在办公室里启动一台汽油发电机。我再也不会那么做了。</p>
<p>I don’t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you’d endure in an ordinary working life. It’s probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it’s compressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That’s the way to think about it if you’re trying to decide whether to start one. If you’re the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.<br>我认为在初创公司里，你要处理的烦心事并不比在普通工作中多。事实上，可能更少；只是因为被压缩在短时间内，所以显得很多。所以，初创公司主要给你带来的是时间。如果你在考虑是否要创办一家初创公司，可以这样想：如果你是那种想一次性解决金钱问题，而不是靠工资工作 40 年的人，那么创办初创公司是有意义的。</p>
<p>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school. Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups. You may worry that if you do you’ll blow your chances of an academic career. But it’s possible to be part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first. Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got their degrees. There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.<br>对很多人来说，冲突在于初创公司和研究生院之间。研究生的年龄和特质，正好适合创办软件初创公司。你可能担心，如果你这么做了，会毁掉学术生涯的机会。但加入初创公司的同时留在研究生院是可能的，尤其是在初期。我们最初的三个程序员中，有两个一直在读研究生，而且都拿到了学位。拖延的研究生身上蕴含的能量，几乎没有什么能比得上。</p>
<p>If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won’t be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.<br>如果你确实不得不离开研究生院，最坏的情况是，离开的时间不会太长。如果初创公司失败了，很可能会失败得很快，你可以回到学术生活中去。如果成功了，你可能会发现，自己不再那么渴望成为一名助理教授了。</p>
<p>If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside. It’s not something you have to know about “business” to do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is that?<br>如果你想做，就去做吧。创办初创公司并不像外界看起来那么神秘。你不需要懂 “商业” 才能做。做出用户喜欢的东西，并且支出少于收入。这有那么难吗？</p>
<h3 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a><strong>Notes</strong></h3><p>[1] Google’s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.<br>[1] 谷歌每年的收入约为 20 亿美元，但其中一半来自其他网站上的广告。</p>
<p>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you’re not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you’re not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you’re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.<br>[2] 初创公司相对于成熟企业的一个优势是，创办企业时没有反歧视法的限制。例如，我不愿意和有小孩或即将有小孩的女性一起创办初创公司。但你不能询问潜在员工是否计划近期生孩子。信不信由你，根据美国现行法律，你甚至不能以智力为由进行歧视。然而，在创办公司时，你可以根据任何你想要的标准来选择合作伙伴。</p>
<p>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own. For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor’s fifteen year old son, you’ll be well on your way.<br>[3] 学编程比读商学院便宜得多，因为大部分可以自学。买一台 Linux 电脑、一本《C 程序设计语言》（K&amp;R），再让邻居 15 岁的儿子给你提点几小时建议，你就差不多入门了。</p>
<p>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.<br>[4] 推论：避免创办向最大的 “公司”—— 政府 —— 销售产品的初创公司。诚然，向政府出售技术有很多机会，但让别人去创办这类公司吧。</p>
<p>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there’s more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.<br>[5] 一个在德国创办公司的朋友告诉我，那里的人很在意文书工作，而且这类工作特别多。这也在一定程度上解释了为什么德国的初创公司没有那么多。</p>
<p>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company. But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.<br>[6] 在种子轮，我们公司的估值原则上是 10 万美元，因为朱利安获得了公司 10% 的股份。但这个数字非常有误导性，因为钱是朱利安给我们的所有东西中最不重要的。</p>
<p>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains. But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.<br>[7] 这一点也适用于那些似乎想收购你的公司。有些公司可能只是假装收购，实则想窃取你的想法。但你永远无法确定哪些是这样的公司，所以最好的做法是表面上完全坦诚，却对几个关键技术秘密避而不谈。</p>
<p>[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.<br>[8] 当年我待的那家公司很糟糕，而我作为员工也一样差劲。我向所有曾和我在那里共事过的人道歉。</p>
<p>[9] You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.<br>[9] 你大概可以写一本书，主题是 “如何通过做与车管所（DMV）完全相反的事来在商业上取得成功”。</p>
