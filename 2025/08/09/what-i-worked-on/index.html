<p>February 2021</p>
<h3 id="1979"><a href="#1979" class="headerlink" title="1979"></a>1979</h3><p>Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn’t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.</p>
<p>上大学前，除了学业，我主要投入的两件事是写作和编程。我写的不是散文，而是当时（或许现在依然）新手作家该写的东西：短篇小说。我的小说糟透了，几乎没有情节，只有充满强烈情感的角色 —— 我曾以为这会让故事显得深刻。</p>
<p>The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called “data processing.” This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district’s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain’s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.</p>
<p>我最早尝试写程序是在学区用于 “数据处理” 的 IBM 1401 电脑上。那是九年级，我大概 13 或 14 岁。学区的 1401 恰好在我们初中的地下室，我和朋友里奇・德雷夫斯获准使用它。那地方像个迷你邦德反派的巢穴：CPU、磁盘驱动器、打印机、读卡机，这些长得像外星造物的机器架在高架地板上，被明亮的荧光灯照着。</p>
<p>The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.</p>
<p>我们用的是早期版本的 Fortran。得把程序打在穿孔卡上，再把卡片堆进读卡机，按个按钮，程序就会载入内存运行。结果通常是在震耳欲聋的打印机上打出点东西。</p>
<p>I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn’t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there’s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn’t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn’t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn’t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I’m not surprised I can’t remember any programs I wrote, because they can’t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn’t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager’s expression made clear.</p>
<p>我对 1401 很困惑，不知道能用它做什么。现在回想，其实我也做不了多少事。程序的唯一输入方式是穿孔卡上的数据，可我没有任何存在穿孔卡上的数据。另一个选择是做不需要输入的事，比如计算圆周率的近似值，但我的数学知识不足以支撑这类有趣的尝试。所以我记不起自己写过什么程序也不奇怪 —— 它们本就干不了什么。我最清晰的记忆是，当我发现程序可能无限循环时，我的某个程序就陷入了这种状态。在没有分时系统的机器上，这不仅是技术错误，更是社交错误 —— 数据中心经理的表情把这点说得明明白白。</p>
<p>With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]</p>
<p>微型计算机的出现改变了一切。现在，电脑能就放在你面前的桌上，运行时能响应你的按键，而不是啃完一叠穿孔卡就停下来。[1]</p>
<p>The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.</p>
<p>我的朋友中第一个有微型计算机的人是自己组装的 —— 那是 Heathkit 公司卖的套件。我清楚记得看着他坐在电脑前直接输入程序时，心里的震撼和羡慕。</p>
<p>Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he’d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.</p>
<p>那时候电脑很贵，我软磨硬泡了好几年，才说服父亲在 1980 年左右买了一台 TRS-80。当时的黄金标准是 Apple II，但 TRS-80 也够用了。就是从这时起，我才真正开始编程：写简单的游戏、预测模型火箭飞行高度的程序，还有一个文字处理器 —— 我父亲用它至少写了一本书。内存只能存大约两页文本，所以他每次写两页就打印出来，但这已经比打字机好太多了。</p>
<h3 id="1985"><a href="#1985" class="headerlink" title="1985"></a>1985</h3><p>Though I liked programming, I didn’t plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn’t much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.</p>
<p>虽然我喜欢编程，但没打算在大学学这个。我本想学生哲学 —— 这听起来更 “厉害”。在天真的高中生眼里，哲学研究的是终极真理，相比之下，其他学科的内容都只是 “领域知识”。但到了大学我才发现，其他学科已经占据了思想领域的大部分空间，留给这些所谓 “终极真理” 的地方所剩无几。哲学似乎只剩下其他学科认为可以安全忽略的边缘问题。</p>
<p>I couldn’t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.</p>
<p>18 岁时我还说不清这些。我只知道，我一门接一门地选哲学课，却一门比一门觉得无聊。于是我决定转去学人工智能（AI）。</p>
<p>AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven’t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don’t know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we’d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.</p>
<p>20 世纪 80 年代中期，AI 风头正劲，但有两件事尤其让我想投身其中：海因莱茵的小说《严厉的月亮》，里面有个叫 “迈克” 的智能电脑；还有 PBS 的一部纪录片，讲特里・威诺格拉德用 SHRDLU（一种自然语言处理程序）的场景。我没再重读《严厉的月亮》，不知道它现在读起来怎么样，但当时我完全被它的世界吸引了。我觉得拥有 “迈克” 只是时间问题，而看到威诺格拉德用 SHRDLU 时，我甚至觉得这一天最多只要几年 —— 只要教 SHRDLU 更多单词就行。</p>
<p>There weren’t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers’ ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL&#x2F;I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn’t happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.</p>
<p>康奈尔大学当时没有 AI 课，连研究生课都没有，所以我开始自学。这意味着要学 Lisp—— 那时候 Lisp 被视为 AI 的语言。当时常用的编程语言都很原始，程序员的思路也相应受限。康奈尔的默认语言是类似 Pascal 的 PL&#x2F;I，其他地方也差不多。学 Lisp 让我对 “程序” 的认知飞速拓展，过了好几年我才摸到新的边界。这才像话 —— 这才是我对大学的期待。虽然它没发生在课堂上，但没关系。接下来的几年，我一路顺风顺水，知道自己要做什么。</p>
<p>For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief — hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 — that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.</p>
<p>我的本科毕业论文是逆向工程 SHRDLU。天啊，我太爱做这个程序了。它的代码很精妙，但更让我兴奋的是一种信念 —— 现在很难想象，但在 1985 年并不少见 —— 我觉得它已经踏上了智能的初级阶段。</p>
<p>I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn’t make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose “Artificial Intelligence.” When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.</p>
<p>康奈尔有个特殊项目，不用选专业：可以随便选课，学位上的内容也可以自己定。我当然选了 “人工智能”。但拿到实体文凭时，我沮丧地发现，引号被保留了下来，看起来像 “讽刺性引号”。当时这让我很不爽，现在却觉得讽刺般地准确 —— 原因我很快就会发现。</p>
<p>I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I’d visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who’d invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.</p>
<p>我申请了 3 所研究生院：当时以 AI 闻名的 MIT 和耶鲁，还有哈佛 —— 我因为里奇・德雷夫斯在那而去过，而且比尔・伍兹也在哈佛，他发明了我在 SHRDLU 复制品中用的解析器类型。只有哈佛录取了我，所以我去了哈佛。</p>
<p>I don’t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that’s told “the dog is sitting on the chair” translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.</p>
<p>我不记得具体是哪一刻，甚至不确定有没有某个具体时刻，但研一的时候，我意识到当时实践中的 AI 是个骗局。我指的是那种：程序被告知 “狗坐在椅子上”，就把这句话转换成某种形式化表示，再加入 “已知信息” 列表的 AI。</p>
<p>What these programs really showed was that there’s a subset of natural language that’s a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.</p>
<p>这些程序真正展示的是：自然语言中存在一个子集是形式语言，但只是非常小的子集。很明显，它们能做的事和真正理解自然语言之间，有一道无法逾越的鸿沟。事实证明，根本不是 “教 SHRDLU 更多单词” 那么简单。那种用明确数据结构表示概念的 AI 路子，走不通。和很多情况一样，这种 “行不通” 催生了大量论文，讨论各种 “补丁”，但永远也造不出 “迈克”。</p>
<p>So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It’s scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there’s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn’t published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.</p>
<p>于是我在计划的残骸中寻找能挽救的东西 —— 找到了 Lisp。我从经验中知道，Lisp 本身就很有趣，不只是因为和 AI 有关，尽管当时人们关注它主要是因为 AI。所以我决定专注于 Lisp，甚至想写一本关于 Lisp 编程的书。现在想来，刚开始写的时候，我对 Lisp 编程的了解少得吓人。但没什么比写一本关于某件事的书更能帮你学会它了。这本书叫《On Lisp》，1993 年才出版，但大部分是在研究生院写的。</p>
<p>Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.</p>
<p>计算机科学是 “理论” 和 “系统” 两部分的微妙结合：理论研究者证明东西，系统研究者构建东西。我想构建东西。我很尊重理论 —— 甚至暗自觉得它可能是更值得钦佩的那一半 —— 但构建东西看起来有趣得多。</p>
<p>The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn’t last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.</p>
<p>但系统工作的问题是不持久。你今天写的程序，无论多好，最多几十年就会过时。人们可能在脚注里提到你的软件，但没人会真的用它。而且它看起来会很简陋，只有了解这个领域历史的人才知道，它在当时有多出色。</p>
<p>There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.</p>
<p>有一次，计算机实验室里有一些多余的施乐 Dandelion 电脑，谁想玩都可以拿一台。我一时有点动心，但以现在的标准看它们太慢了 —— 有什么意义呢？其他人也不想要，最后它们就被处理掉了。系统工作的命运就是这样。</p>
<h3 id="1988"><a href="#1988" class="headerlink" title="1988"></a>1988</h3><p>I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.</p>
<p>我不仅想构建东西，还想构建能持久的东西。</p>
<p>In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I’d spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn’t become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.</p>
<p>带着这种不满，1988 年我去卡内基梅隆大学看望里奇・德雷夫斯（他在那读博）。有一天我去了卡内基研究所 —— 小时候我常去那。看着一幅画时，我突然明白了一件现在看来很明显、但当时让我很惊讶的事：挂在墙上的画，是一种能持久的创造。绘画不会过时，有些最棒的画已经有几百年历史了。</p>
<p>And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn’t have a boss, or even need to get research funding.</p>
<p>而且，靠这个能谋生。当然，不像写软件那么容易，但我想，只要足够勤奋、生活节俭，肯定能赚到活下去的钱。而且作为艺术家，你能真正独立：没有老板，甚至不需要申请研究经费。</p>
<p>I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I’d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art — that it didn’t just appear spontaneously — but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.</p>
<p>我一直喜欢看画，但我能画吗？我不知道。我从没想过这有可能。我理智上知道艺术是人创造的 —— 不是凭空出现的 —— 但总觉得创造艺术的人是另一个物种：要么是很久以前的人，要么是《生活》杂志上那些做着奇怪事的神秘天才。“创作” 艺术 —— 把这个动词放在名词前面 —— 这个想法本身就像奇迹。</p>
<p>That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.</p>
<p>那年秋天，我开始在哈佛上艺术课。研究生可以选任何系的课，我的导师汤姆・奇塔姆很随和。就算他知道我选了些奇怪的课，也从没说过什么。</p>
<p>So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.</p>
<p>就这样，我在计算机科学博士项目里，却计划当艺术家，同时还真心热爱 Lisp 编程、忙着写《On Lisp》。换句话说，和很多研究生一样，我在为很多不是论文的项目拼命。</p>
<p>I didn’t see a way out of this situation. I didn’t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he’d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.</p>
<p>我找不到出路。不想从研究生院退学，但除此之外还有什么办法？记得 1988 年，我朋友罗伯特・莫里斯因为写了互联网蠕虫程序被康奈尔开除时，我甚至有点羡慕 —— 他找到了这么 “精彩” 的退学方式。</p>
<h3 id="1990"><a href="#1990" class="headerlink" title="1990"></a>1990</h3><p>Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn’t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay “Yes, I think so. I’ll give you something to read in a few days.”</p>
<p>1990 年 4 月的一天，事情有了转机。我碰到奇塔姆教授，他问我能不能在 6 月毕业。我的论文一个字都没写，但这辈子最快的思考可能就是那一刻了：我决定赌一把，在剩下的 5 周左右时间里写出来，能复用《On Lisp》的部分就复用。我立刻回答：“可以，我想没问题。几天后给您东西看。”</p>
<p>I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There’s a whole world there that’s barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.</p>
<p>我选了 “延续的应用” 作为主题。现在想来，我本该写宏和嵌入式语言 —— 那片领域几乎还没被探索过。但我只想离开研究生院，仓促写就的论文刚好够格。</p>
<p>Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.</p>
<p>同时，我在申请艺术学校：美国的 RISD（罗德岛设计学院）和佛罗伦萨美术学院 —— 我觉得它是最古老的艺术学校，应该很棒。RISD 录取了我，佛罗伦萨那边没消息，所以我准备去普罗维登斯（RISD 所在地）。</p>
<p>I’d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.</p>
<p>我申请的是 RISD 的 BFA 项目，相当于再上一次大学。这没听起来那么奇怪，因为我才 25 岁，艺术学校里各种年龄的人都有。RISD 把我算成转学生，大二，说我得在夏天上基础课 —— 所有人都要学的绘画、色彩、设计之类的基础课。</p>
<p>Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they’d sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I’d done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.</p>
<p>夏末，我收到了一个大惊喜：佛罗伦萨美术学院的信。信被耽搁了，因为他们寄到了英国剑桥，而不是美国马萨诸塞州的剑桥。信里邀请我秋天去佛罗伦萨参加入学考试，只剩几周时间了。我好心的房东让我把东西放在她的阁楼里。我在研究生院做咨询攒了些钱 —— 省着花的话，大概够活一年。现在，我只需要学意大利语。</p>
<p>Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don’t know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]</p>
<p>只有 “外国人” 需要参加入学考试。现在想来，这可能是为了排挤外国人 —— 太多外国人被 “在佛罗伦萨学艺术” 吸引，不然意大利学生可能会被淹没。那个夏天在 RISD 的基础课让我的绘画和素描还算过得去，但我至今不知道怎么通过笔试的。我记得作文题是写塞尚，我把 intellectual 层面拉到最高，好掩盖词汇量的不足。[2]</p>
<p>I’m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn’t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn’t require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they’d seen in American art magazines.</p>
<p>才 25 岁，人生的模式就已经很明显了：我又一次进入某个名校，希望学习某个 “高大上” 的学科，又一次即将失望。佛罗伦萨美术学院绘画系的师生人都超好，但他们早就达成了默契：学生不要求老师教东西，老师也不要求学生学东西。同时，所有人都表面上遵守 19 世纪画室的规矩。我们真的有那种小炉子，烧柴的，就像你在 19 世纪画室画里看到的那样，还有个裸体模特坐在旁边，离炉子近得差点烧到。但除了我，几乎没人画她。其他学生都在聊天，偶尔模仿美国艺术杂志上的东西。</p>
<p>Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She’d copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he’d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]</p>
<p>后来发现，那个模特就住在我街对面。她靠当模特和给当地古董商仿画谋生：从书里找一幅冷门的古画临摹，然后古董商把仿品做旧。[3]</p>
<p>While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can’t move. People can’t sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don’t sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you’re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you’re seeing. You don’t want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it’s been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it’s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]</p>
<p>在美术学院上学时，我开始晚上在卧室画静物。画很小，因为房间小，而且我用的是剩画布 —— 当时只买得起这个。画静物和画人不一样，顾名思义，静物不会动。人一次最多坐 15 分钟，还坐不稳。所以画人的传统方法是：先会画 “通用的人”，再根据具体的人修改。而静物呢，只要你想，可以像像素级复制一样照着画。但当然不能只停在这一步，不然就只是照片级的准确。静物的有趣之处在于它经过了人的思考：你要强调那些视觉线索，比如某个地方颜色突变，是因为那是物体的边缘。通过巧妙强调这些，你能画出比照片更 “真实” 的画 —— 不只是比喻意义上，而是严格的信息论意义上。[4]</p>
<p>I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren’t consciously aware of much we’re seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain “that’s a water droplet” without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or “that’s a bush” without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there’s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.</p>
<p>我喜欢画静物，因为我好奇自己看到的东西。日常生活中，我们不会有意识地注意大部分所见。多数视觉感知由低层处理完成，只告诉大脑 “那是水滴”，却不说最亮和最暗的点在哪里；或者 “那是灌木”，却不说每片叶子的形状和位置。这是大脑的功能，不是缺陷 —— 日常生活中，注意每片叶子会很分心。但当你必须画某样东西时，就得看得更仔细，这时你会发现太多细节。就算画的是人们习以为常的东西，画了几天之后，你仍能发现新东西 —— 就像写一篇关于习以为常的事物的散文，写了几天还能有新发现。</p>
<p>This is not the only way to paint. I’m not 100% sure it’s even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.</p>
<p>这不是唯一的绘画方式，我也不确定它是不是好方式。但当时觉得值得一试。</p>
<p>Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn’t teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.</p>
<p>我们的老师乌利维教授人很好。他看得出我很努力，给了我好成绩，写在每个学生都有的那种 “护照” 上。但美术学院只教会了我意大利语，钱也快花光了，所以第一年末我回了美国。</p>
<p>I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]</p>
<p>我想回 RISD，但已经没钱了，而且 RISD 很贵。于是我决定先工作一年，明年秋天再回去。我在一家叫 Interleaf 的公司找到了工作 —— 他们做文档创建软件。你是说像微软 Word？没错。就是这样，我明白了低端软件往往会吃掉高端软件。但 Interleaf 当时还能撑几年。[5]</p>
<p>Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they’d added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I’ve had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn’t know C and didn’t want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.</p>
<p>Interleaf 做过一件很大胆的事：受 Emacs 启发，他们加了一种脚本语言，还是 Lisp 的方言。现在他们需要一个 Lisp 程序员用它写东西。这是我最接近 “正常工作” 的一次，在此我要向老板和同事道歉 —— 我是个糟糕的员工。他们的 Lisp 就像巨大 C 语言蛋糕上薄薄的糖霜，而我不懂 C，也不想学，所以始终没搞懂大部分软件。再加上我极其不负责任：那时候编程工作意味着每天在特定时间到岗，这在我看来很不自然。现在世界似乎在向我这边倾斜，但当时这造成了很多摩擦。那年快结束时，我大部分时间都在偷偷写《On Lisp》—— 当时已经签了出版合同。</p>
<p>The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.</p>
<p>好处是薪水很高，以艺术生的标准看尤其如此。在佛罗伦萨，付完房租后，我每天其他开销的预算是 7 美元。现在，就算只是坐在会议里，每小时也能赚 4 倍多。省着花不仅攒够了回 RISD 的钱，还还清了大学贷款。</p>
<p>I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it’s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it’s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there’s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.</p>
<p>在 Interleaf 学到了些有用的东西，不过大多是 “不该做什么”：科技公司最好由产品人而非销售人运营（虽然销售是真本事，厉害的人是真厉害）；太多人改代码会出 bug；办公室再便宜，太压抑也不值；计划好的会议不如走廊闲聊；大客户的钱很危险；常规工作时间和编程的最佳时间没多少重叠，常规办公室也不是编程的最佳地点。</p>
<p>But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it’s good to be the “entry level” option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you’re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.</p>
<p>但最重要的是，我学到了一个后来在 Viaweb 和 Y Combinator 都用到的道理：低端吃掉高端。做 “入门级” 选项很好，虽然没那么光鲜，因为如果你不做，别人也会做，然后把你挤垮。这意味着，“光鲜” 是个危险信号。</p>
<p>When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.</p>
<p>第二年秋天离开 Interleaf 回 RISD 时，我安排了为客户项目组做 freelance（自由职业），接下来几年就靠这个活。后来回去做项目时，有人跟我提了个叫 HTML 的新东西，说它是 SGML 的衍生品。Interleaf 里到处都是标记语言爱好者，我没当回事 —— 但这个 HTML 后来成了我生活的重要部分。</p>
<h3 id="1992"><a href="#1992" class="headerlink" title="1992"></a>1992</h3><p>In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.</p>
<p>1992 年秋天，我回到普罗维登斯继续上 RISD。基础课只是入门，佛罗伦萨美术学院像个（很文明的）笑话。现在我要看看真正的艺术学校是什么样 —— 但可惜，它和美术学院差不多。组织得更好，也贵得多，但越来越明显：艺术学校和艺术的关系，不像医学院和医学的关系 —— 至少绘画系是这样。我隔壁邻居所在的纺织系似乎很严格，插画和建筑系大概也是。但绘画系已经 “后严格” 了：绘画学生应该 “表达自己”，对更世故的人来说，这意味着搞出某种独特的标志性风格。</p>
<p>A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a “schtick”: something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else’s. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it’s by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That’s not always why artists have a signature style, but it’s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]</p>
<p>标志性风格就像娱乐圈的 “噱头”，能让作品一眼被认出是你的。比如看到某种卡通风格的画，就知道是罗伊・利希滕斯坦的。所以如果对冲基金经理的公寓里挂着一幅这种画，你就知道他花了几百万。这不全是艺术家搞标志性风格的原因，但往往是买家愿意花大价钱的原因。[6]</p>
<p>There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who “could draw” in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.</p>
<p>也有很多认真的学生：高中 “会画画”，来到这所号称全国最好的艺术学校，想画得更好。他们在 RISD 往往感到困惑和挫败，但还是坚持，因为画画是他们的事业。我不是高中就会画画的人，但在 RISD，我肯定更接近他们，而不是那些追求标志性风格的人。</p>
<p>I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn’t much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]</p>
<p>在 RISD 的色彩课上学到了很多，但其他时候基本是自学绘画 —— 这完全可以免费做。所以 1993 年我退学了。在普罗维登斯待了一阵，大学朋友南希・帕梅特帮了我个大忙：她妈妈在纽约有栋楼，里面有个租金管制的公寓要空出来，问我要不要。比我当时的住处大不了多少，但纽约据说是艺术家该待的地方。当然要！[7]</p>
<p>Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there’s a tiny corner that’s not rich, or at least wasn’t in 1993. It’s called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist — in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.</p>
<p>《高卢英雄传》漫画开头，镜头拉近到罗马高卢的一个小角落，发现那里没被罗马人控制。在纽约地图上也能这么做：拉近上东区，有个小角落不富裕 —— 至少 1993 年是这样。那地方叫约克维尔，成了我的新家。现在，我是纽约艺术家了 —— 严格来说，就是画画，住纽约。</p>
<p>I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn’t want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)</p>
<p>我很担心钱，因为感觉 Interleaf 在走下坡路。Lisp 自由职业的活很少，我又不想用其他语言编程 —— 那时候运气好的话是 C++。于是，凭着我对赚钱机会的 “敏锐” 嗅觉，我决定再写一本 Lisp 的书。这次要写本通俗的，能当教材的。我想象自己靠版税节俭生活，把所有时间都用来画画。（《ANSI Common Lisp》这本书的封面画，就是我那时候画的。）</p>
<p>The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I’d taken her painting class at Harvard. I’ve never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.</p>
<p>纽约对我来说最好的是有伊德尔和朱利安・韦伯。伊德尔・韦伯是画家，早期照相写实主义者之一，我在哈佛上过她的绘画课。我从没见过哪个老师像她这样受学生爱戴，很多往届学生都和她保持联系，包括我。搬到纽约后，我成了她事实上的工作室助理。</p>
<p>She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn’t that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don’t I become rich? Then I’ll be able to work on whatever I want.</p>
<p>她喜欢在大的方形画布上画，边长 4 到 5 英尺。1994 年底的一天，我正在绷一幅这样的巨画，收音机里在说一个著名的基金经理。他没比我大多少，却超级有钱。我突然想：我为什么不变得有钱呢？那样就能做任何想做的事了。</p>
<p>Meanwhile I’d been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I’d seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.</p>
<p>与此同时，我越来越多地听到 “万维网” 这个新东西。去剑桥看望罗伯特・莫里斯（他当时在哈佛读博）时，他给我演示了一下。我觉得网络会成大事。我见过图形用户界面（GUI）如何让微型计算机普及，网络似乎会让互联网也这样。</p>
<p>If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can’t honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn’t want to be online, and still don’t, not the fancy ones. That’s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.</p>
<p>如果想变富，这就是下一班列车。这部分我是对的。错的是想法：我决定开公司，帮艺术画廊上网。看了那么多 Y Combinator 的申请后，我坦白说，这不算最烂的创业想法，但也差不多了。艺术画廊不想上网，现在也不想 —— 至少高档画廊不想，这不是他们的销售方式。我写了些软件帮画廊生成网站，罗伯特写了些代码调整图片大小、搭 HTTP 服务器。然后我们试着签画廊。说这是 “难卖” 都太轻了 —— 简直是送都送不出去。几个画廊让我们免费做了网站，但没人付钱。</p>
<p>Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we’d been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an “internet storefront” was something we already knew how to build.</p>
<p>后来一些在线商店出现了，我意识到除了 “下单” 按钮，它们和我们给画廊做的网站一模一样。那个听起来很厉害的 “互联网店面”，我们早就会做了。</p>
<p>So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we’d at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores — in Lisp, of course.</p>
<p>1995 年夏天，我把《ANSI Common Lisp》的终稿交给出版商后，我们开始写构建在线商店的软件。一开始想做普通桌面软件 —— 那时候意味着 Windows 软件。这很吓人，因为我们俩都不会写 Windows 软件，也不想学。我们活在 Unix 世界里。但还是决定先在 Unix 上试试做个商店构建器的原型：罗伯特写购物车，我写新的商店网站生成器 —— 当然用 Lisp。</p>
<p>We were working out of Robert’s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we’d never have to write anything to run on users’ computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we’d serve them from. Users wouldn’t need anything more than a browser.</p>
<p>我们在剑桥罗伯特的公寓里工作。他的室友经常不在，我就能睡他房间。不知为什么，那房间没有床架和床单，只有床垫放地上。一天早上躺在床垫上时，我突然坐直了：如果软件跑在服务器上，用户点链接控制它呢？这样就永远不用写用户端软件了。可以在服务器上生成网站，用户只需要浏览器。</p>
<p>This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn’t clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.</p>
<p>这种叫 “网页应用” 的软件现在很常见，但当时甚至不清楚是否可行。为了验证，我们决定做一个能通过浏览器控制的商店构建器。几天后的 8 月 12 日，我们做成了一个能运行的版本。界面很烂，但证明了完全可以通过浏览器建商店，不需要任何客户端软件，也不用在服务器命令行输入东西。</p>
<p>Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn’t need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.</p>
<p>我们觉得这下真的找对了方向。我甚至幻想新一代软件都这样：不用考虑版本、移植之类的破事。在 Interleaf，有个叫 “发布工程” 的团队，规模似乎和写软件的团队差不多大。而现在，直接在服务器上更新软件就行。</p>
<p>We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle’s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator’s. We knew founders needed something like this, because we’d needed it ourselves.</p>
<p>我们开了家新公司，叫 Viaweb—— 因为软件通过网络（via the web）工作。伊德尔的丈夫朱利安给了 1 万美元种子投资，作为回报，我们给了他 10% 的股份（他还做了初期法务、给了商业建议）。十年后，这成了 Y Combinator 的模式：我们知道创始人需要这样的帮助，因为我们自己就需要过。</p>
<p>At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I’d made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.</p>
<p>当时我的净资产是负的 —— 银行里的一千美元左右，还不够欠政府的税（我有没有认真存下 Interleaf 咨询工作的钱？当然没有）。所以虽然罗伯特有研究生津贴，我得靠这笔种子投资生活。</p>
<p>We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.</p>
<p>我们原本希望 9 月上线，但越做越想把软件弄好。最终做出了一个所见即所得（WYSIWYG）的网站构建器：创建页面时，看起来和最终生成的静态页面完全一样，只是链接指向的不是静态页面，而是服务器哈希表里存的闭包。</p>
<p>It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.</p>
<p>学过艺术帮了忙：在线商店构建器的核心是让用户看起来 “正规”，而正规的关键是高制作水准。只要页面布局、字体、颜色对了，一个在卧室开商店的人能看起来比大公司还正规。</p>
<p>(If you’re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it’s because it’s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)</p>
<p>（如果你好奇我的网站为什么这么老派，因为它还用着这个软件。现在看可能粗糙，但 1996 年时，它是最 slick 的。）</p>
<p>In September, Robert rebelled. “We’ve been working on this for a month,” he said, “and it’s still not done.” This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.</p>
<p>9 月，罗伯特反抗了：“我们都做了一个月了，还没弄完。” 现在想来很有趣，因为他之后差不多还做了 3 年。但我觉得招更多程序员可能稳妥，问罗伯特研究生院里谁最厉害。他推荐了特雷弗・布莱克威尔 —— 一开始我很惊讶，因为当时我知道特雷弗主要是因为他想把生活里的一切都记在一叠卡片上，走到哪带到哪。但罗伯特说得对，特雷弗是个极其高效的黑客。</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They’re the two most independent-minded people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm’s brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor’s it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.</p>
<p>和罗伯特、特雷弗一起工作很开心。他们是我认识的最有独立思想的人，方式还完全不同。如果能看到罗伯特的大脑，会像新英格兰殖民时期的教堂；看到特雷弗的，会像奥地利洛可可风格最夸张的样子。</p>
<h3 id="1996"><a href="#1996" class="headerlink" title="1996"></a>1996</h3><p>We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]</p>
<p>1996 年 1 月，我们正式营业，有 6 家商店。还好等了几个月 —— 虽然担心迟到，但其实早得差点致命。当时媒体大谈电子商务，但没多少人真的想要在线商店。[8]</p>
<p>There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn’t have to integrate with any other software except Robert’s and Trevor’s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I’d had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.</p>
<p>软件主要有三部分：我写的编辑器（用户用来建网站）、罗伯特写的购物车、特雷弗写的管理器（跟踪订单和数据）。当时，这个编辑器是最好的通用网站构建器之一。我把代码写得很紧凑，只需要和罗伯特、特雷弗的软件集成，所以做起来很开心。如果只需要做这个软件，接下来 3 年可能是我人生最轻松的时光。但不幸的是，我还得做很多其他事 —— 都是我比编程差的事，所以接下来 3 年反而是最紧张的。</p>
<p>There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn’t because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.</p>
<p>90 年代后半期，很多创业公司做电子商务软件。我们决心做 “微软 Word”，而不是 “Interleaf”—— 意思是易用、便宜。幸运的是我们很穷，这让 Viaweb 比预想的还便宜：小店每月 100 美元，大店 300 美元。低价很有吸引力，也让竞争对手头疼，但我们定低价不是因为聪明 —— 我们根本不知道企业愿意付多少钱，300 美元对我们来说已经很多了。</p>
<p>We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what’s now called “doing things that don’t scale,” although at the time we would have described it as “being so lame that we’re driven to the most desperate measures to get users.” The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d’etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.</p>
<p>我们很多 “做对” 的事都是偶然。比如现在说的 “做不可规模化的事”，当时我们会说 “太逊了，只能用最 desperation 的办法拉用户”—— 最常见的是帮用户建商店。这很丢人，因为软件的意义本就是让用户自己做。但为了拉用户，什么都愿意做。</p>
<p>We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man’s shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men’s shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.</p>
<p>我们学到了太多不想知道的零售业知识。比如，如果只能放一张男士衬衫的小图（当时所有图都比现在小），放衣领特写比整件衬衫好。我记得这个是因为我得重新扫描约 30 张衬衫图 —— 第一批扫描还那么好看。</p>
<p>Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by “business” and thought we needed a “business person” to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we’d have so many users that I couldn’t scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.</p>
<p>虽然感觉不对，但这正是该做的事。帮用户建商店让我们了解了零售，也了解了用我们软件的感受。一开始我对 “商业” 既困惑又反感，觉得需要 “商业人士” 来管，但有了用户后，我改变了 —— 就像有了孩子后对父亲身份的态度转变。用户想要什么，我都满足。也许有一天用户太多，我没时间帮他们扫描图片，但现在没什么比这更重要。</p>
<p>Another thing I didn’t get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that’s how much money you’re making, and if you’re not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we’d been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you’re doing fine. You’re growing 7x a year. Just don’t hire too many more people and you’ll soon be profitable, and then you’ll control your own destiny.</p>
<p>当时没明白的另一件事：增长率是创业公司的终极考验。我们的增长率不错：1996 年底约 70 家店，1997 年底约 500 家。我错误地认为绝对用户数才重要 —— 这确实重要，因为关系到收入，不够的话可能倒闭。但长期来看，增长率会解决绝对数问题。如果是我在 Y Combinator 指导的创业公司，我会说：别紧张，你们做得很好，年增长 7 倍。别雇太多人，很快就会盈利，然后就能掌握自己的命运了。</p>
<p>Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that’s what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn’t reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.</p>
<p>可惜我雇了很多人，部分是因为投资者想让我雇，部分是因为互联网泡沫时期的创业公司都这样 —— 只有几个人的公司会显得业余。所以直到 1998 年夏天雅虎收购我们时，才实现收支平衡。这意味着公司整个生命周期都得看投资者脸色。我们和投资者都是创业新手，结果一团糟，就算以创业公司的标准看也是。</p>
<p>It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn’t feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.</p>
<p>雅虎收购我们时，我如释重负。理论上，Viaweb 的股票很值钱 —— 它是一家盈利且快速增长的企业的股份。但我没觉得它多值钱：我不知道怎么给企业估值，却太清楚我们几乎每隔几个月就经历一次 “濒死体验”。而且创业以来，我的生活方式还和研究生差不多。所以雅虎收购时，我感觉像从赤贫到暴富。要去加州了，我买了辆车 ——1998 年的黄色大众 GTI。我记得当时想，光是真皮座椅就比我所有东西加起来都豪华。</p>
<h3 id="1998"><a href="#1998" class="headerlink" title="1998"></a>1998</h3><p>The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo’s prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.</p>
<p>接下来的一年，1998 年夏到 1999 年夏，可能是我人生效率最低的时期。当时没意识到，我已经被运营 Viaweb 的压力和精力耗尽了。到加州后，我试着继续编程到凌晨 3 点，但疲劳加上雅虎老气横秋的文化和圣克拉拉沉闷的格子间，渐渐把我拖垮了。几个月后，感觉诡异得像在 Interleaf 工作。</p>
<p>Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they’d never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I’d painted anything that I’d half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men’s shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.</p>
<p>雅虎收购时给了我们很多期权。当时我觉得雅虎估值太高，期权肯定不值钱，但没想到接下来一年股价涨了 5 倍。我等到第一批期权解禁，1999 年夏天就离开了。太久没画画，我都快忘了为什么要做这些。四年来，脑子里全是软件和男士衬衫。但我提醒自己，变得有钱是为了画画，现在有钱了，该去画画了。</p>
<p>When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.</p>
<p>我说要走时，雅虎的老板和我长谈了我的计划。我告诉他想画什么样的画。当时还感动于他这么关心我，现在才明白他以为我在撒谎。我当时的期权每月约值 200 万美元，放弃这么多钱，肯定是要去开新公司，还可能挖人。那是互联网泡沫顶峰，雅虎是中心。我老板当时是亿万富翁，在那时离开去开新公司，在他看来可能是疯狂又合理的野心。</p>
<p>But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I’d already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That’s what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.</p>
<p>但我真的是辞职去画画，而且立刻就开始了。不能再等了，已经花了四年变富。现在我跟那些卖掉公司离开的创始人说，我的建议总是一样的：度假。我当时就该这么做，去个地方什么都不做一两个月，但根本没想过。</p>
<p>So I tried to paint, but I just didn’t seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn’t know many people in California. I’d compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you’ll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn’t know any of them.</p>
<p>于是我试着画画，却没精力和野心。部分原因是在加州没什么熟人。我还在圣克鲁斯山买了栋房子，风景很美，但离任何地方都很远。又撑了几个月，绝望之下回了纽约 —— 你可能会惊讶，我还保留着那个公寓，像旧生活的坟墓一样封着。至少伊德尔在纽约，还有其他想画画的人，虽然我都不认识。</p>
<p>When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn’t been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I’d paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn’t rotted yet).</p>
<p>回到纽约，我重拾旧生活，只是现在有钱了。听起来很怪，确实很怪。所有旧习惯都回来了，但多了很多以前没有的 “门”：累了不想走路，举手就能拦到出租车（除非下雨）；路过可爱的小餐馆，能进去点份午餐。兴奋了一阵，画画也渐渐顺了。我尝试了一种新静物：先用老方法画一幅，拍照打印在画布上（放大），然后用这个当底色，再对着同样的物体画第二幅（希望物体还没烂）。</p>
<p>Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn’t one. Huh.</p>
<p>同时，我在找公寓买。现在终于能选邻居了。我问自己和各种房产中介：纽约的 “剑桥” 在哪？偶尔去真正的剑桥后，我渐渐意识到没有这样的地方。嗯。</p>
<h3 id="2000"><a href="#2000" class="headerlink" title="2000"></a>2000</h3><p>Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.</p>
<p>2000 年春天左右，我有了个想法。从 Viaweb 的经历看，网页应用显然是未来。为什么不做一个 “用来做网页应用” 的网页应用呢？让人们通过浏览器在我们的服务器上编辑代码，然后我们托管生成的应用。[9] 服务器上可以运行各种服务，应用调用 API 就能用：打电话、处理图片、收信用卡付款等等。</p>
<p>I got so excited about this idea that I couldn’t think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn’t particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he’d made a lot of money the last time I’d lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.</p>
<p>我太兴奋了，满脑子都是这个。未来显然是这样的。我不是特别想开公司，但这个想法显然需要公司来实现，所以决定搬到剑桥去开。希望能说服罗伯特一起做，但碰壁了。罗伯特当时是 MIT 的博士后，虽然上次跟着我搞事赚了不少，但也花了太多时间。他觉得想法可行，却坚决拒绝加入。</p>
<p>Hmph. Well, I’d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it’s now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn’t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we’d hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.</p>
<p>哼，那我自己做。我招了曾在 Viaweb 工作的丹・吉芬，还有两个想找暑期工的本科生，开始做一个现在看来相当于 20 家公司加几个开源项目的软件。定义应用的语言当然是 Lisp 的方言。但我没天真到以为能直接给大众用 Lisp，得像 Dylan 语言那样隐藏括号。</p>
<p>By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an “application service provider,” or ASP. This name didn’t last long before it was replaced by “software as a service,” but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.</p>
<p>当时把 Viaweb 这类公司叫 “应用服务提供商”（ASP），这个名字没火多久就被 “软件即服务”（SaaS）取代了，但火的那阵，我给新公司起了个名：Aspra。</p>
<p>I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn’t want to run a company — especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I’d only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn’t need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I’d build a subset that could be done as an open source project.</p>
<p>我做应用构建器，丹做网络基础设施，两个本科生做前两个服务（图片和电话）。但夏天过半时，我意识到自己真的不想运营公司 —— 尤其是看起来会变大的公司。我开 Viaweb 只是因为需要钱，现在不缺钱了，为什么还要做这个？如果这个愿景必须靠公司实现，那算了。我可以做个子集，当成开源项目。</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.</p>
<p>没想到，花在这上面的时间没白费。Y Combinator 创办后，我经常遇到做这个新架构部分内容的创业公司，而我花了这么多时间思考甚至尝试写过，这非常有用。</p>
<p>The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn’t even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.</p>
<p>我要做的开源子集是新 Lisp—— 现在连括号都不用隐藏了。很多 Lisp 黑客都梦想做新 Lisp，部分因为 Lisp 的特色是有方言，部分因为我们心里都有个 “柏拉图式的 Lisp”，现有方言都不够格。我当然也有。夏天结束时，丹和我搬到剑桥我买的房子里，开始做这个叫 Arc 的新 Lisp 方言。</p>
<p>The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we’d used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I’d created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]</p>
<p>第二年春天，转机来了。我被邀请在一个 Lisp 会议上演讲，讲了我们在 Viaweb 用 Lisp 的经历。之后把演讲稿（PostScript 格式）放到了<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paulgraham.com/">paulgraham.com</a>上 —— 这个网站我用 Viaweb 建了好几年，从没用来做过什么。一天之内，它有了 3 万次浏览。怎么回事？从引用链接看，有人把它发到了 Slashdot 上。[10]</p>
<p>Wow, I thought, there’s an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.</p>
<p>哇，我想，有受众。写点东西放网上，谁都能看。现在看来再平常不过了，但当时很惊人。印刷时代，通往读者的渠道很窄，被称为 “编辑” 的凶猛怪物把守着。想让作品有受众，必须出书、登报或发杂志。现在，任何人都能发表任何东西。</p>
<p>This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]</p>
<p>理论上 1993 年就可以了，但没多少人意识到。我参与构建网络基础设施这么久，自己也是作家，却花了 8 年才意识到。即便如此，又过了好几年才明白其中的意义：这意味着会有新一代的散文。[11]</p>
<p>In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]</p>
<p>印刷时代，发表散文的渠道窄得可怜。除了少数在纽约参加对的派对、被官方认可的思想家，只有专家能发表关于自己领域的散文。太多散文从没被写出来，因为没地方发表。现在可以了，我要写这些散文。[12]</p>
<p>I’ve worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I’d always write essays too.</p>
<p>我做过很多事，但如果说有个转折点让我明白该做什么，那就是开始在网上发表散文的时候。从那以后，我知道无论做什么，都会一直写散文。</p>
<p>I knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they’d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.</p>
<p>我知道网络散文一开始会是边缘媒介。社交层面上，它们更像疯子在 GeoCities 网站上发的咆哮，而不是《纽约客》上排版精美的优雅文章。但这时我已经明白，这是好事，不是坏事。</p>
<p>One of the most conspicuous patterns I’ve noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren’t prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I’m writing, and I explain that it’s an essay I’m going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.</p>
<p>我人生中最明显的模式之一是：对我来说，做那些不那么光鲜的事，往往效果很好。静物一直是最不光鲜的绘画形式；Viaweb 和 Y Combinator 刚起步时都显得很逊；现在别人问我在写什么，我说要发在自己网站上的散文时，还是会看到对方茫然的眼神。就连 Lisp，虽然在智力上像拉丁语一样有光环，也差不多够 “不潮” 了。</p>
<p>It’s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it’s a sign both that there’s something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren’t prestigious doesn’t guarantee you’re on the right track, it at least guarantees you’re not on the most common type of wrong one.</p>
<p>不是说不光鲜的工作本身就好。但如果你被某种工作吸引，尽管它现在不光鲜，这既说明那里有真东西可发现，也说明你的动机是对的。不纯的动机是野心家的大危险 —— 最可能让你误入歧途的，就是想给别人留下深刻印象的欲望。所以，做不光鲜的事不能保证你走在对的路上，但至少保证你没走最常见的错路。</p>
<p>Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O’Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers &amp; Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.</p>
<p>接下来几年，我写了很多散文，主题各异。奥莱利出版社把其中一些编成书，以其中一篇的标题《黑客与画家》为名出版。我还做了垃圾邮件过滤器，画了些画。每周四晚上我会请一群朋友吃饭，这让我学会了给很多人做饭。我在剑桥又买了栋楼 —— 以前是糖果厂（据说后来是色情工作室），当办公室用。</p>
<h3 id="2003"><a href="#2003" class="headerlink" title="2003"></a>2003</h3><p>One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn’t know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn’t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.</p>
<p>2003 年 10 月的一个晚上，我家开了个大派对。这是我朋友玛丽亚・丹尼尔斯（周四晚宴的常客）的好主意：三个主人各自邀请朋友参加同一个派对，这样每个客人都会有三分之二的人不认识但可能合得来。其中一个客人我不认识，但后来很喜欢：她叫杰西卡・利文斯顿。几天后，我约了她。</p>
<p>Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.</p>
<p>杰西卡在波士顿一家投资银行管营销。这家银行觉得自己懂创业公司，但接下来一年，她认识了我那些创业圈的朋友后，惊讶地发现现实完全不同，他们的故事也很精彩。于是她决定编一本创业公司创始人的访谈录。</p>
<p>When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.</p>
<p>银行出现财务问题，她不得不解雇一半员工，于是开始找新工作。2005 年初，她去波士顿一家风投公司面试营销岗。他们拖了几周才做决定，这段时间里，我跟她讲了风投需要改进的地方：应该多投小额，而不是少数大额；应该投更年轻、更懂技术的创始人，而不是 MBA；应该让创始人继续当 CEO，等等。</p>
<p>One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won’t waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they’d be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we’d made.</p>
<p>我写散文有个诀窍：先演讲。想到要站在一群人面前，说些不浪费他们时间的话，这能极大激发想象力。哈佛计算机协会（本科生电脑俱乐部）邀请我演讲时，我决定讲讲如何开创业公司 —— 也许他们能避免我们犯过的那些严重错误。</p>
<p>So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they’d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I’d only known), I blurted out “But not me!” and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I’d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn’t done one angel investment.</p>
<p>演讲中，我说最好的种子投资来源是成功的创业公司创始人，因为他们还能提供建议。说完，似乎所有人都期待地看着我。想到收件箱会被商业计划淹没（当时要是知道就好了），我脱口而出：“但别找我！” 然后继续演讲。但之后我想，真该停止拖延，开始做天使投资了。雅虎收购我们后我就想做，现在已经过去 7 年，还没做过一次。</p>
<p>Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.</p>
<p>同时，我还在和罗伯特、特雷弗合计能一起做的项目。我怀念和他们共事的日子，总觉得有什么可以合作的。</p>
<p>As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We’d start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we’d been talking about. I’d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we’d get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]</p>
<p>3 月 11 日，我和杰西卡吃完饭回家，走到花园街和沃克街的拐角，这三条线交汇了：去他的那些拖拖拉拉的风投，我们自己开投资公司，把想法付诸实践。我出钱，杰西卡辞职来做，再拉罗伯特和特雷弗当合伙人。[13]</p>
<p>Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.</p>
<p>无知再次帮了我们。我们不知道怎么当天使投资人，2005 年的波士顿也没有罗恩・康威（著名天使投资人）可以学。所以我们只做看起来明显该做的事，有些做法后来发现还挺新颖。</p>
<p>There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn’t figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn’t go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we’d been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.</p>
<p>Y Combinator 有很多部分，我们不是一下子想出来的。最先确定的是做天使投资公司。那时候，“天使” 和 “公司” 这两个词还不搭：有风投公司（有组织的公司，雇人做投资），但只投百万美元级的大额；有天使投资人（投小额），但都是个人，通常有其他主业，投资只是副业。而且两者在早期都不够帮助创始人。我们知道创始人在某些方面有多无助，因为我们自己就经历过。比如朱利安帮我们注册公司时，我们觉得太神奇了 —— 写复杂软件还行，但注册公司、定章程、发股票，到底怎么弄？我们的计划是：不仅做种子投资，还要为创业公司做所有朱利安为我们做过的事。</p>
<p>YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking “Wow, that means they got all the returns.” But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn’t know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn’t have known where to start. [14]</p>
<p>YC 不是基金形式。运营成本低，用我们自己的钱就行。99% 的读者可能没注意，但专业投资者会想：“哇，这意味着他们拿了所有回报。” 但这也不是因为我们多聪明 —— 我们根本不知道风投公司怎么组织，没想过要募资，就算想过也不知道从哪开始。[14]</p>
<p>The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they’d start startups instead? We wouldn’t feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn’t make much money out of it, we’d at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.</p>
<p>YC 最独特的是 “批次模式”：一次投一批创业公司，一年两次，然后花三个月集中帮助它们。这也是偶然发现的，完全是因为我们不懂投资。我们需要投资经验，觉得 “一次投一堆创业公司” 是个好办法。我们知道本科生夏天会去科技公司做临时工作，那为什么不组织个暑期项目，让他们开创业公司呢？这样我们就算 “假投资人” 也不会内疚，因为他们也算 “假创始人”。所以就算赚不到钱，至少能练手，他们呢，夏天也比去微软打工有趣。</p>
<p>We’d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We’d all have dinner there once a week — on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays — and after dinner we’d bring in experts on startups to give talks.</p>
<p>我们用我在剑桥买的那栋楼当总部。每周二一起吃晚饭（周四我已经在请人吃饭了），饭后请创业领域的专家来讲课。</p>
<p>We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get “deal flow,” as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who’d already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we’d intended.</p>
<p>知道本科生在决定暑期工作，所以几天内我们搞出了 “夏季创始人计划”，我在自己的网站上发了公告，邀请本科生申请。从没想过写散文能带来投资者说的 “deal flow”（项目流），但事实证明这是完美的来源。[15] 我们收到了 225 份申请，惊讶地发现很多来自已经毕业或即将毕业的人。这个计划突然变得比预想的严肃。</p>
<p>We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don’t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>我们从 225 个团队中邀请了约 20 个来面试，最终选了 8 个投资。他们很出色：第一批包括 reddit、后来创办 Twitch 的贾斯汀・坎和埃米特・希尔、已经帮着写了 RSS 规范、几年后成为开放获取殉道者的亚伦・斯沃茨，还有后来成为 YC 第二任总裁的山姆・奥特曼。第一批这么好，不全是运气 —— 愿意参加 “夏季创始人计划” 这种怪事，而不是去微软或高盛这种正经地方实习，本身就需要很大勇气。</p>
<p>The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]</p>
<p>给创业公司的条件结合了我们和朱利安的协议（1 万美元换 10%）以及罗伯特说的 MIT 研究生暑期能拿到的钱（6000 美元）：每个创始人 6000 美元，典型的两个创始人团队就是 1.2 万美元，换 6% 的股份。这肯定公平，因为比我们自己当年的条件好一倍。而且那个夏天特别热，杰西卡还给创始人送了免费空调。[16]</p>
<p>Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.</p>
<p>很快我意识到，我们偶然发现了规模化创业投资的方法。批量投资对我们更方便，因为能同时为很多创业公司做事；对创业公司也更好，解决了创始人最大的问题之一：孤独。现在他们有了同事，而且是懂他们面临的问题、能分享解决方案的同事。</p>
<p>As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another’s customers. We used to refer jokingly to the “YC GDP,” but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.</p>
<p>随着 YC 发展，我们发现了规模的其他好处：校友形成了紧密的社区，愿意互相帮助，尤其是帮助当前批次的创始人 —— 他们还记得自己曾处于同样的位置。我们还发现创业公司之间会互相成为客户。我们曾开玩笑说 “YC GDP”，但随着 YC 壮大，这越来越不像玩笑。现在很多创业公司的初始客户几乎全来自同批次的伙伴。</p>
<p>I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.</p>
<p>我本来没打算把 YC 当全职工作。我想做三件事：编程、写散文、做 YC。但随着 YC 发展，我越来越投入，它占据的精力远超过三分之一。但头几年我还能做其他事。</p>
<h3 id="2006"><a href="#2006" class="headerlink" title="2006"></a>2006</h3><p>In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn’t startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one’s intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>2006 年夏天，我和罗伯特开始做新版本的 Arc。这个版本速度不错，因为编译成了 Scheme。为了测试，我用它写了 Hacker News（黑客新闻）。最初叫 “创业新闻”，是给创业公司创始人的新闻聚合器，但几个月后，我厌倦了只看创业相关的内容。而且我们想触达的不是现有创始人，而是未来的创始人。于是改名叫 “黑客新闻”，主题变成任何能激发智力好奇心的东西。</p>
<p>HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I’d had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one’s work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]</p>
<p>HN 对 YC 当然有好处，但也是我最大的压力来源。如果只需要挑选和帮助创始人，生活会轻松很多。这意味着 HN 可能是个错误。工作中最大的压力来源至少应该接近核心，但我就像跑马拉松时，痛苦不是来自跑步的劳累，而是来自不合脚的鞋磨出的水泡。处理 YC 的紧急问题时，约 60% 和 HN 有关，40% 是其他所有事加起来。[17]</p>
<p>As well as HN, I wrote all of YC’s internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn’t have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.</p>
<p>除了 HN，YC 所有内部软件我也用 Arc 写。但虽然还在用 Arc，我渐渐不再改进它 —— 部分因为没时间，部分因为现在有这么多基础设施依赖它，改起来就没那么有吸引力了。于是我的三个项目减到两个：写散文和做 YC。</p>
<p>YC was different from other kinds of work I’ve done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn’t have picked a better way to do it.</p>
<p>YC 和我做过的其他工作都不同。不是我自己决定做什么，而是问题来找我。每 6 个月就有一批新的创业公司，它们的问题 —— 无论是什么 —— 都成了我们的问题。这工作很有吸引力，因为问题五花八门，优秀的创始人效率很高。如果想在最短时间内了解最多关于创业公司的事，没有比这更好的方式了。</p>
<p>There were parts of the job I didn’t like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn’t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: “No one works harder than the boss.” He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I’d better work very hard.</p>
<p>有些部分我不喜欢：创始人之间的纠纷、判断谁在撒谎、和欺负创业公司的人斗争等等。但就算不喜欢，我也很努力。凯文・黑尔曾说过一句话让我不安：“没人比老板更努力。” 他既是描述也是建议，而建议的部分吓到我了。我想让 YC 变好，所以如果我的努力程度决定了其他人的上限，那我必须非常努力。</p>
<h3 id="2010"><a href="#2010" class="headerlink" title="2010"></a>2010</h3><p>One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. “You know,” he said, “you should make sure Y Combinator isn’t the last cool thing you do.”</p>
<p>2010 年的一天，罗伯特・莫里斯来加州面试，做了件惊人的事：主动给我提建议。我只记得他以前做过一次 —— 在 Viaweb 时，我肾结石疼得直不起腰，他建议最好送我去医院。只有这种时候，罗伯特才会主动提建议。所以我清楚记得他的话：“你知道吗，你该确保 Y Combinator 不是你做的最后一件酷事。”</p>
<p>At the time I didn’t understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life’s work or I’d have to leave eventually. And it wasn’t, so I would.</p>
<p>当时我不明白他的意思，渐渐才意识到他是说我该离开了。这听起来很奇怪，因为 YC 做得很好。但罗伯特主动提建议比他犯错还罕见，所以我开始思考。确实，按当时的轨迹，YC 会是我做的最后一件事 —— 它占据的精力越来越多，已经吃掉了 Arc，正在吃掉散文。要么 YC 是我一生的事业，要么我最终得离开。它不是，所以我会离开。</p>
<h3 id="2012"><a href="#2012" class="headerlink" title="2012"></a>2012</h3><p>In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.</p>
<p>2012 年夏天，我母亲中风了，原因是结肠癌引起的血栓。中风破坏了她的平衡能力，她被送进疗养院，但她真想离开，回自己家 —— 我和姐姐决心帮她实现。我定期飞俄勒冈看她，在飞机上有很多时间思考。一次飞行中，我意识到自己准备好把 YC 交给别人了。</p>
<p>I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn’t, so we decided we’d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn’t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we’d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.</p>
<p>我问杰西卡想不想当总裁，她不想，于是我们决定试着招募山姆・奥特曼。我们和罗伯特、特雷弗谈过，同意彻底交接：到那时为止，YC 由我们四个成立的 LLC 控制，但我们想让 YC 长久存在，这意味着不能由创始人控制。所以如果山姆同意，就让他重组 YC：我和罗伯特退休，杰西卡和特雷弗当普通合伙人。</p>
<p>When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he’d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.</p>
<p>我们问山姆想不想当 YC 总裁时，他一开始说不 —— 他想做一个核能反应堆的创业公司。但我坚持，2013 年 10 月他终于同意了。决定从 2014 年冬季批次开始由他接手。2013 年剩下的时间里，我越来越多地让山姆运营 YC，部分是让他学习，部分是因为我在关注母亲 —— 她的癌症复发了。</p>
<p>She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.</p>
<p>她在 2014 年 1 月 15 日去世了。我们早有准备，但事到临头还是很难受。</p>
<p>I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I’m interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)</p>
<p>我继续在 YC 工作到 3 月，帮那批创业公司做完演示日，然后就基本退出了（我还会和校友以及做我感兴趣的事的新创业公司聊天，但每周只花几小时）。</p>
<p>What should I do next? Rtm’s advice hadn’t included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I’d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]</p>
<p>接下来该做什么？罗伯特的建议没说。我想做完全不同的事，于是决定画画 —— 想看看如果全心投入，能画多好。所以停止做 YC 的第二天，我就开始画画了。手很生，过了一阵子才找回状态，但至少非常投入。[18]</p>
<p>I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I’d never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I’d always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven’t painted since. So far anyway.</p>
<p>2014 年剩下的时间，我大部分在画画。以前从没这么不间断地工作过，确实比以前画得好 —— 虽然还不够好，但有进步。11 月，画到一半时，我突然没动力了。在此之前，我总是好奇正在画的画最后会是什么样，但突然觉得完成这幅画像个负担。于是我停下，洗了画笔，从此没再画过 —— 至少到现在。</p>
<p>I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that’s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it’s getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.</p>
<p>我知道这听起来有点懦弱，但注意力是零和游戏。如果能选要做的事，却选了一个不是最适合（至少不是好的）自己的项目，那它就会妨碍那个更适合的项目。50 岁了，浪费时间的机会成本很高。</p>
<p>I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren’t about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.</p>
<p>我又开始写散文，接下来几个月写了不少新的，甚至有几篇不是关于创业的。2015 年 3 月，我又开始做 Lisp。</p>
<p>The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn’t originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what’s the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]</p>
<p>Lisp 的独特之处在于，它的核心是一种 “用自身定义解释器” 的语言。它最初不是普通意义上的编程语言，而是作为计算的形式模型，是图灵机的替代方案。如果你想用一种语言自己写它的解释器，需要最少多少个预定义操作符？约翰・麦卡锡发明（或者说发现）的 Lisp，就是这个问题的答案。[19]</p>
<p>McCarthy didn’t realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy’s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn’t match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn’t understand why at the time.</p>
<p>麦卡锡没意识到这种 Lisp 能用来编程，直到他的研究生史蒂夫・拉塞尔提议。拉塞尔把麦卡锡的解释器翻译成 IBM 704 的机器语言，从那时起，Lisp 才开始成为普通意义上的编程语言。但它作为 “计算模型” 的起源，赋予了它其他语言无法比拟的力量和优雅。大学时吸引我的就是这个，虽然当时不知道为什么。</p>
<p>McCarthy’s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you’d want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren’t defined using McCarthy’s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn’t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you’d have had to run it, and computers then weren’t powerful enough.</p>
<p>麦卡锡 1960 年的 Lisp 只能解释 Lisp 表达式，缺了很多编程语言该有的东西。这些都得补上，但补充时并没有用麦卡锡最初的公理方法。当时这不可行 —— 麦卡锡通过手工模拟程序执行来测试解释器，但这已经快到极限了，他甚至没发现其中一个 bug。要测试更复杂的解释器，得运行它，而当时的电脑不够强。</p>
<h3 id="2015"><a href="#2015" class="headerlink" title="2015"></a>2015</h3><p>Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy’s axiomatic approach till you’d defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy’s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.</p>
<p>但现在的电脑性能够了。现在可以继续用麦卡锡的公理方法，直到定义出一门完整的编程语言。而且，只要对麦卡锡 Lisp 的每一处修改都保持 “可发现性”，理论上就能得到一门有这种特质的完整语言。说起来容易做起来难，但既然理论上可行，为什么不试试？于是我决定尝试，花了 4 年，从 2015 年 3 月 26 日到 2019 年 10 月 12 日。幸好目标明确，不然很难坚持这么久。</p>
<p>I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it’s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.</p>
<p>我用 Arc 语言在 Arc 里写了这个新 Lisp，叫 Bel。这听起来像矛盾，但也说明我为了让它工作用了多少技巧。通过一堆极端的 hack，我做出了一个接近 “用自身写的解释器” 的东西，还能真的运行 —— 不快，但够测试用。</p>
<p>I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I’d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you’re working on an interpreter written in itself, it’s hard to keep track of what’s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.</p>
<p>这段时间我几乎不能写散文，不然永远完不成。2015 年底我花了 3 个月写散文，回头做 Bel 时，几乎看不懂代码了 —— 不是写得烂，而是问题太复杂。当你在做 “用自身写的解释器” 时，很难追踪不同层级发生的事，错误传到你这的时候，几乎像加密过一样。</p>
<p>So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I’d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I’d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking “Does Paul Graham still code?”</p>
<p>所以我说，Bel 完成前不写散文。但我没告诉多少人在做 Bel。所以几年来，人们可能觉得我什么都没做，其实我在拼命工作，比以往任何时候都努力。偶尔和某个恶心的 bug 搏斗几小时后，我会刷推特或 HN，看到有人问：“保罗・格雷厄姆还编程吗</p>
<p>Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.</p>
<p>做 Bel 很难，但很满足。我投入得很深，任何时候脑子里都装着一大部分代码，还能在脑子里写新的。记得 2015 年一个晴天，带孩子们去海边，看着他们在潮池里玩时，我想通了如何处理和延续（continuation）有关的某个问题。当时觉得人生就该这样。我记得这个，是因为这种感觉太新奇了 —— 好在接下来几年，这样的时刻越来越多。</p>
<p>In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.</p>
<p>2016 年夏天，我们搬到了英国。想让孩子们体验在另一个国家生活，而我生来是英国公民，所以这是 obvious 的选择。本来只想待一年，但太喜欢了，现在还住在这。所以 Bel 大部分是在英国写的。</p>
<p>In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy’s original Lisp, it’s a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy’s Lisp it’s a spec expressed as code.</p>
<p>2019 年秋天，Bel 终于完成了。和麦卡锡最初的 Lisp 一样，它是规范而非实现，尽管也像麦卡锡的 Lisp 一样，规范是用代码表达的。</p>
<p>Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I’d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who’d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.</p>
<p>终于能再写散文了，我把攒的一堆主题都写了。2020 年一直在写，同时开始想其他能做的事。该怎么选？过去是怎么选的？我给自己写了篇散文回答这个问题，惊讶地发现答案又长又乱。连亲身经历的我都惊讶，也许这对别人也会有趣，对那些人生同样混乱的人也是鼓励。于是我写了个更详细的版本给别人看 —— 这就是最后一句话。</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.</p>
<p>[1] 我的经历跳过了计算机发展的一个阶段：带交互式操作系统的分时机器。我直接从批处理过渡到了微型计算机，这让微型计算机显得格外令人兴奋。</p>
<p>[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It’s the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.</p>
<p>[2] 表示抽象概念的意大利语词汇，几乎都能通过英语同源词推测出来（偶尔有 “polluzione” 这样的陷阱词除外）。差异主要体现在日常用词上。所以，如果你用几个简单动词串联起大量抽象概念，一点点意大利语就能派上大用场。</p>
<p>[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.</p>
<p>[3] 我住在圣菲利切广场 4 号，所以步行去美术学院的路线正好穿过老佛罗伦萨的核心：经过皮蒂宫，过桥，路过奥尔圣米凯莱教堂，走在圣母百花大教堂和洗礼堂之间，然后沿里卡索利街走到圣马可广场。我见过佛罗伦萨街头的各种模样 —— 从空旷昏暗的冬夜，到游客摩肩接踵的闷热夏日。</p>
<p>[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they’re willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.</p>
<p>[4] 当然，只要愿意，你也可以像画静物一样画人。这种肖像画可以说是静物绘画的巅峰，尽管长时间静坐往往会让模特表情显得痛苦。</p>
<p>[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore’s Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.</p>
<p>[5] Interleaf 是众多 “有聪明人、造得出厉害技术，却被摩尔定律击垮” 的公司之一。20 世纪 90 年代，商用（即英特尔）处理器的算力呈指数级增长，像推土机一样碾压了高端专用硬件和软件公司。</p>
<p>[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren’t specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.</p>
<p>[6] RISD 里追求标志性风格的人并非刻意逐利。在艺术界，金钱和 “酷” 紧密绑定：任何昂贵的东西都会被视为酷，而任何被视为酷的东西很快也会变得同样昂贵。</p>
<p>[7] Technically the apartment wasn’t rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.</p>
<p>[7] 严格来说，那个公寓不是 “租金管制”（rent-controlled），而是 “租金稳定”（rent-stabilized），但这种细微差别只有纽约人才会知道或在意。关键是它真的很便宜，还不到市场价的一半。</p>
<p>[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it’s done. But when the software is an online store builder and you’re hosting the stores, if you don’t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.</p>
<p>[8] 大多数软件一完成就能发布。但如果是在线商店构建器，且由你托管这些商店，那么 “还没有用户” 这个事实就会格外扎眼。所以在公开上线前，我们必须先 “私下发布”—— 也就是招募一批初始用户，确保他们的商店看起来像模像样。</p>
<p>[9] We’d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn’t know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn’t an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants’ sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.</p>
<p>[9] 我们在 Viaweb 里加了个代码编辑器，让用户可以自定义页面样式。他们不知道的是，自己编辑的其实是 Lisp 表达式。但这算不上应用编辑器，因为代码是在商家网站生成时运行的，而非购物者访问时。</p>
<p>[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren’t they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I’m not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don’t already know, and some people dislike being told such things.</p>
<p>[10] 这是如今常见体验的第一次出现，后续发生的事也一样：我读评论时，发现满是愤怒的人。我怎么敢说 Lisp 比其他语言好？它们不都是图灵完备的吗？看到我文章评论的人有时会同情我，但我毫不夸张地说，从一开始就是这样。这是领域自带的属性：一篇文章必须告诉读者他们不知道的事，而有些人讨厌被这样对待。</p>
<p>[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.</p>
<p>[11] 当然，20 世纪 90 年代人们就往网上发了很多东西，但 “把东西放上网” 和 “在网上发布” 不是一回事。“在网上发布” 意味着你把在线版本视为（至少是其中一个）主要版本。</p>
<p>[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs’ customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.</p>
<p>[12] 这里有一个普遍规律，我们在 Y Combinator 的经历也印证了这一点：即使催生习俗的限制早已消失，习俗仍会长期束缚你。就像出版散文的习俗一样，风投的传统做法也曾基于真实限制 —— 创业曾经成本高昂，因此相对罕见。现在创业可以既便宜又普遍，但风投的习俗仍反映着旧世界，就像散文写作的习俗仍受限于印刷时代的约束一样。</p>
<p>Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).</p>
<p>这反过来意味着：在受快速变革影响的领域（习俗更可能过时），思想独立的人（即受习俗影响较小的人）会更有优势。</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting point, though: you can’t always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?</p>
<p>不过有个有趣的点：你没法总能预测哪些领域会被快速变革影响。软件和风投显然会，但谁能想到散文写作也会呢？</p>
<p>[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn’t want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.</p>
<p>[13] Y Combinator 不是最初的名字。一开始我们叫 “剑桥种子”（Cambridge Seed）。但我们不想要区域性名字，怕硅谷有人模仿，于是以 λ 演算里最酷的技巧之一 ——Y 组合子（Y combinator）—— 重新命名。</p>
<p>I picked orange as our color partly because it’s the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.</p>
<p>我选橙色作为我们的代表色，一部分是因为它最温暖，另一部分是因为没有风投用过这个颜色。2005 年，所有风投都用暗红、藏蓝、深绿这类沉稳颜色，因为他们想吸引的是有限合伙人（LP），而非创始人。YC 的 logo 本身是个圈内笑话：Viaweb 的 logo 是红色圆圈里一个白色 V，所以我把 YC 的 logo 设计成橙色方块里一个白色 Y。</p>
<p>[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.</p>
<p>[14] 2009 年起，YC 曾有几年以基金形式运营，因为规模太大，我个人已无力承担资金。但 Heroku 被收购后，我们有了足够资金，又回到了自资模式。</p>
<p>[15] I’ve never liked the term “deal flow,” because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it’s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.</p>
<p>[15] 我一直不喜欢 “项目流”（deal flow）这个词，因为它暗示某一时期的新创业公司数量是固定的。这不仅是错的，更是 YC 要打破的 —— 我们就是要促成那些本不会存在的创业公司诞生。</p>
<p>[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.</p>
<p>[16] 她（杰西卡）说，那些空调大小形状各不相同，因为当时空调热销，她能买到什么就拿了什么，但每个都比她现在能搬动的重得多。</p>
<p>[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you’re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you’re present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it’s correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.</p>
<p>[17] HN 的另一个问题是个诡异的边缘情况：当你既写散文又运营论坛时，矛盾就来了。运营论坛时，人们会默认你就算没看所有对话，至少也看了所有涉及你的对话；而写散文时，人们会在论坛上对文章做出天马行空的误读。这两种情况单独出现时虽烦人但可忍受，结合在一起却很要命：你必须回应误读，因为 “你在关注对话” 的默认设定意味着，对任何获赞足够多的误读不回应，就会被视作默认其正确。但这又会鼓励更多误读 —— 任何想和你争执的人都会觉得，机会来了。</p>
<p>[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We’d been working on YC almost the whole time we’d known each other, and we’d neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.</p>
<p>[18] 离开 YC 最难受的是不能再和杰西卡一起工作。我们认识的几乎所有时间都在做 YC，从未试图或想过把工作和私人生活分开，所以离开就像拔起一棵深根的树。</p>
<p>[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy’s 1960 paper.</p>
<p>[19] 要更精准地理解 “发明” 与 “发现” 的区别，可以聊聊外星文明。比如，任何足够先进的外星文明肯定都知道勾股定理。我虽没那么确定，但相信他们也会知道麦卡锡 1960 年论文里的 Lisp 语言。</p>
<p>But if so there’s no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I&#x2F;O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy’s Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.</p>
<p>若真是这样，就没理由认为这是他们可能知道的语言的极限。想必外星人也需要数字、错误处理和输入输出。所以，从麦卡锡的 Lisp 出发，很可能存在至少一条能保留 “可发现性” 的发展路径。</p>
