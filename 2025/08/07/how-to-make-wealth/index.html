<p>(This essay was originally published in Hackers &amp; Painters.)</p>
<p>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That’s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word “startup” dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>（本文最初发表于《黑客与画家》）</p>
<p>如果你想致富，你会怎么做？我认为最好的办法是创办或加入一家创业公司。几百年来，这一直是一条可靠的致富途径。“创业公司” 一词可追溯到 20 世纪 60 年代，但创业公司所做的事，与中世纪那些有风险投资支持的贸易远航极为相似。</p>
<p>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase “high-tech startup” is almost redundant. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.</p>
<p>创业公司通常与技术相关，以至于 “高科技创业公司” 这个说法几乎显得多余。创业公司就是一家致力于解决棘手技术问题的小公司。</p>
<p>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don’t have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?</p>
<p>很多人仅凭这一点就发了财。就像优秀的棒球投手不一定需要懂物理一样，创业也未必需要懂底层逻辑。但我认为，理解这些底层逻辑能让你更有优势。为什么创业公司必须保持小规模？随着规模扩大，创业公司是否必然不再是 “创业公司”？它们为什么常常专注于开发新技术？为什么有那么多创业公司在研发新药或开发软件，却没有一家在卖玉米油或洗衣液？</p>
<p><strong>The Proposition</strong></p>
<h3 id="核心逻辑"><a href="#核心逻辑" class="headerlink" title="核心逻辑"></a><strong>核心逻辑</strong></h3><p>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</p>
<p>从经济角度看，创业可以理解为一种将整个职业生涯压缩到几年内的方式。你不必低强度地工作四十年，而是尽最大可能高强度地工作四年。这在技术领域的回报尤其丰厚，因为在这个领域，快速工作能带来额外收益。</p>
<p>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you’re a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour. [1] You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I’m claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you’re expected to be in a random corporate job. [2] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.</p>
<p>以下是这种经济逻辑的简要概述。如果你是一名 25 岁左右的优秀黑客，你能找到一份年薪约 8 万美元的工作。因此，平均来看，这样的黑客每年至少要为公司创造 8 万美元的价值，公司才能实现收支平衡。你或许能比企业员工多工作一倍的时间，而且如果专注投入，每小时的产出可能是他们的三倍。[1] 此外，在大公司里，你得忍受那些 “地中海发型” 中层经理的拖累，而创业能让你摆脱这种拖累，这至少又能带来一倍的效率提升。还有一个乘数：你比岗位描述所期望的水平要聪明多少？假设这个乘数是 3。把所有这些乘数相乘，我认为你在创业时的生产力，可能是在普通企业岗位上的 36 倍。[2] 如果一名不错的黑客在大公司年薪 8 万美元，那么一名聪明的黑客在没有企业繁文缛节拖累的情况下拼命工作，每年应该能创造约 300 万美元的价值。</p>
<p>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn’t try to defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I’m not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.</p>
<p>和所有粗略估算一样，这个数字有很大浮动空间。我不会去辩护具体的数值，但我坚信这个计算逻辑。我不是说乘数精确到 36，但它肯定超过 10，而且可能很少达到 100。</p>
<p>If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we’re talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.</p>
<p>如果 300 万美元一年听起来太高，要记住我们说的是极限情况：你不仅没有休闲时间，甚至工作到危害健康的程度。</p>
<p>Startups are not magic. They don’t change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars’ worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can’t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.</p>
<p>创业并非魔法，它不会改变财富创造的规律，只是代表着曲线最末端的一个点。这里存在一条守恒定律：如果你想赚 100 万美元，就得承受价值 100 万美元的痛苦。例如，一种赚 100 万美元的方式是在邮局工作一辈子，把每一分工资都存起来。想象一下在邮局工作 50 年的压力吧。而在创业公司，你把所有这些压力压缩到三四年里。批量承受痛苦确实能享受一定的 “折扣”，但你无法逃避这条基本守恒定律。如果创业很容易，那每个人都会去做。</p>
<p><strong>Millions, not Billions</strong></p>
<h3 id="百万，而非亿万"><a href="#百万，而非亿万" class="headerlink" title="百万，而非亿万"></a><strong>百万，而非亿万</strong></h3><p>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?</p>
<p>如果 300 万美元一年在某些人看来太高，在另一些人看来可能又太低。三百万？我怎么才能像比尔・盖茨那样成为亿万富翁？</p>
<p>So let’s get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It’s not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.</p>
<p>那我们现在就来说说比尔・盖茨。用著名的富豪举例不是个好主意，因为媒体只报道最富有的人，而这些人往往是特例。比尔・盖茨聪明、坚定且勤奋，但要赚他那么多钱，光靠这些还不够，你还需要非常幸运。</p>
<p>There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM’s side, Microsoft’s future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.</p>
<p>任何公司的成功都有很大的随机因素。所以，你最终在报纸上读到的那些人，都是既聪明、又全身心投入，还中了 “彩票” 的人。比尔当然聪明又专注，但微软也恰好受益于商业史上最惊人的失误之一：DOS 系统的授权协议。毫无疑问，比尔尽了全力促使 IBM 犯下这个错误，并且出色地利用了它。但如果 IBM 那边有一个脑子清醒的人，微软的未来会大不相同。在那个阶段，微软对 IBM 几乎没有影响力，实际上只是一个组件供应商。如果 IBM 要求独家授权（他们本该如此），微软还是会签下协议 —— 这仍然能给他们带来很多钱，而 IBM 也能轻易从别处弄到操作系统。</p>
<p>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.</p>
<p>结果却是，IBM 利用其在市场上的所有力量，让微软掌控了个人电脑的标准。从那时起，微软要做的只是执行：他们不必为大胆的决策赌上整个公司，只需对授权商采取强硬态度，并及时模仿更具创新性的产品。</p>
<p>If IBM hadn’t made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he’d be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.</p>
<p>如果 IBM 没有犯这个错，微软仍然会是一家成功的公司，但不可能成长得如此之快、如此之大。比尔・盖茨会很富有，但可能只是福布斯 400 富豪榜中与他同龄的那些人里排名靠后的一个。</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.</p>
<p>致富的方式有很多，本文只讨论其中一种：通过创造财富并从中获得报酬来赚钱。其他方式还有很多，包括机遇、投机、婚姻、继承、盗窃、勒索、欺诈、垄断、贪污、游说、伪造和勘探。大多数巨额财富可能都涉及其中几种方式。</p>
<p>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it’s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it’s more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.</p>
<p>把创造财富作为致富方式的优势，不仅在于它更合法（其他很多方式现在都是非法的），还在于它更直接：你只需要做人们想要的事。</p>
<p><strong>Money Is Not Wealth</strong></p>
<h3 id="金钱不等同于财富"><a href="#金钱不等同于财富" class="headerlink" title="金钱不等同于财富"></a><strong>金钱不等同于财富</strong></h3><p>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.</p>
<p>如果你想创造财富，理解财富是什么会有帮助。财富和金钱不是一回事。[3] 财富和人类历史一样古老，实际上更古老 —— 蚂蚁都有财富。而金钱是相对较新的发明。</p>
<p>Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.</p>
<p>财富是根本。财富是我们想要的东西：食物、衣服、房子、汽车、 小工具、去有趣的地方旅行等等。你可以拥有财富而没有金钱。如果你有一台魔法机器，能按需为你变出汽车、做晚餐、洗衣服，或者做任何你想做的事，你就不需要金钱了。反之，如果你在南极腹地，没有东西可买，那么你有多少钱都没用。</p>
<p>Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money.</p>
<p>财富是你想要的东西，而不是金钱。但如果财富才是重要的，为什么每个人都在谈论赚钱呢？这是一种简略说法：金钱是转移财富的方式，实际上它们通常可以互换。但它们不是一回事，除非你打算通过伪造货币致富，否则谈论 “赚钱” 会让你更难理解如何创造财富。</p>
<p>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can’t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.</p>
<p>金钱是专业化的副产品。在一个专业化的社会里，你需要的大多数东西都无法自己制造。如果你想要一个土豆、一支铅笔或一个住处，你得从别人那里获得。</p>
<p>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can’t get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?</p>
<p>你如何让种土豆的人给你一些土豆？通过给他一些他想要的东西作为回报。但直接用东西和需要它们的人交换，你走不了多远。如果你制作小提琴，而当地农民没人想要，你该怎么吃饭？</p>
<p>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff– the medium of exchange– can be anything that’s rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we’ve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn’t physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>随着社会越来越专业化，人们找到的解决方案是把交易变成两步流程。你不用小提琴直接换土豆，而是用小提琴换某种东西（比如银），然后再用这种东西换你需要的任何东西。这种中间物 —— 交换媒介 —— 可以是任何稀有且便携的东西。历史上，金属是最常见的，但最近我们一直在使用一种名为 “美元” 的交换媒介，它实际上并不存在物理形态。但它能作为交换媒介，是因为美国政府保证了它的稀有性。</p>
<p>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means. People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage– just a shorthand– for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want. [4]</p>
<p>交换媒介的优势是让交易得以进行，劣势是它往往掩盖了交易的真正意义。人们认为企业的作用是赚钱，但金钱只是中间阶段 —— 只是一种简略说法 —— 代表人们想要的任何东西。大多数企业真正做的是创造财富：它们做人们想要的事。[4]</p>
<p><strong>The Pie Fallacy</strong></p>
<h3 id="馅饼谬误"><a href="#馅饼谬误" class="headerlink" title="馅饼谬误"></a><strong>馅饼谬误</strong></h3><p>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that’s not the same thing.</p>
<p>令人惊讶的是，很多人从小就认为世界上的财富总量是固定的。在任何普通家庭中，某一时刻的金钱数量确实是固定的，但这和财富不是一回事。令人惊讶的是，很多人从小就认为世界上的财富总量是固定的。在任何普通家庭中，某一时刻的金钱数量确实是固定的，但这和财富不是一回事。</p>
<p>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. “You can’t make the pie larger,” say politicians. When you’re talking about the amount of money in one family’s bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year’s tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.</p>
<p>在这种语境下谈论财富时，人们常把它描述成一个馅饼。“你不能把馅饼做得更大，” 政客们说。当你谈论一个家庭银行账户里的钱，或者政府一年的税收收入时，这是对的：如果一个人多拿了，另一个人就必须少拿。</p>
<p>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you’re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.</p>
<p>我记得小时候曾认为，如果少数富人拥有所有的钱，留给其他人的就少了。很多人似乎到成年后仍然相信类似的说法。当你听到有人说 “x% 的人拥有 y% 的财富” 时，这种谬误往往就隐藏在背后。如果你打算创办一家创业公司，无论你是否意识到，你都是在计划推翻这种馅饼谬误。</p>
<p>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It’s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.</p>
<p>让人们误入歧途的是金钱的抽象性。金钱不是财富，它只是我们用来转移财富的工具。所以，尽管在某些特定时刻（比如你家这个月），可用来和别人交换你想要的东西的金钱数量是固定的，但世界上的财富总量并不是固定的。你可以创造更多财富。在整个人类历史中，财富一直在被创造和毁灭（但总体上是在被创造）。</p>
<p>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is– and you specifically are– one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you’ll get more for it.</p>
<p>假设你有一辆破旧的老车。明年夏天，你不用坐着无所事事，而是可以花时间把车修复到崭新的状态。在这个过程中，你创造了财富。世界 —— 特别是你 —— 因为多了一辆崭新的老车而变得更富有。而且这不只是比喻意义上的：如果你卖掉这辆车，能得到更多钱。</p>
<p>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven’t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. [5]</p>
<p>修复老车让你变得更富有，而没有让任何人变得更贫穷。所以很明显，财富不是固定的馅饼。事实上，这样想的话，你会奇怪为什么会有人认为财富是固定的。[5]</p>
<p>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don’t have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones– a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.</p>
<p>孩子们本能地知道自己可以创造财富，只是他们没意识到。如果你需要给别人送礼物却没有钱，你会自己做一个。但孩子们不擅长做东西，所以他们认为自制礼物和商店买的是完全不同的、更低等的东西 —— 只是那句老话 “心意最重要” 的一种表达。的确，我们为父母做的那些粗糙的烟灰缸，在二手市场上卖不出什么价钱。</p>
<p><strong>Craftsmen</strong></p>
<h3 id="工匠"><a href="#工匠" class="headerlink" title="工匠"></a><strong>工匠</strong></h3><p>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.</p>
<p>最有可能理解财富可以被创造的人，是那些擅长制作东西的人 —— 工匠。他们手工制作的东西变成了商店里售卖的商品。但随着工业化的兴起，工匠越来越少。现存最大的工匠群体之一是计算机程序员。</p>
<p>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn’t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer. [5b]</p>
<p>程序员可以坐在电脑前创造财富。一个好的软件本身就是有价值的东西，这里没有制造过程来混淆问题 —— 你输入的那些字符就是一个完整的、成品的产品。如果有人坐下来写一个不烂的网页浏览器（顺便说一句，这是个好主意），世界会因此变得更富有。[5b]</p>
<p>Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it’s clearer to programmers that wealth is something that’s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.</p>
<p>公司里的每个人都在共同创造财富，也就是制造更多人们想要的东西。很多员工（比如邮件收发室或人事部的人）的工作与实际制造东西有一层隔阂，但程序员不是。他们真的是一行一行地 “思考” 出产品。因此，程序员更清楚财富是被创造出来的，而不是像想象中的 “爸爸” 分馅饼那样被分配的。</p>
<p>It’s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).</p>
<p>程序员也很清楚，财富创造的速度存在巨大差异。在 Viaweb，我们有一位程序员，他的生产力高得惊人。我记得有一天看他工作了一整天，估算他为公司增加了几十万美元的市值。一个优秀的程序员在状态好的时候，几周内就能创造 100 万美元的财富。而一个平庸的程序员在同样的时间里，可能创造零甚至负的财富（比如引入漏洞）。</p>
<p>This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth– undergraduates, reporters, politicians– hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.</p>
<p>这就是为什么很多最优秀的程序员是自由主义者。在我们的世界里，你要么成功，要么失败，没有借口。那些远离财富创造的人 —— 大学生、记者、政客 —— 听到 “最富有的 5% 的人拥有一半的财富” 时，往往会认为这是不公！而有经验的程序员更可能想：“才这么点？” 最顶尖的 5% 的程序员可能写出了 99% 的优秀软件。</p>
<p>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we’re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I’m running on the computer I’m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.</p>
<p>财富可以在不被出售的情况下被创造。至少直到最近，科学家创造的财富实际上是捐赠出去的。我们都因为知道青霉素而变得更富有，因为我们死于感染的可能性更小了。财富是人们想要的任何东西，而 “不死亡” 显然是我们想要的。黑客经常通过编写开源软件来捐赠自己的工作，任何人都可以免费使用。我因为 FreeBSD 操作系统而变得更富有（我现在用的电脑就运行着它），雅虎也是如此 —— 他们所有的服务器都在运行它。</p>
<p><strong>What a Job Is</strong></p>
<h3 id="工作是什么"><a href="#工作是什么" class="headerlink" title="工作是什么"></a><strong>工作是什么</strong></h3><p>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.</p>
<p>在工业化国家，人们至少在二十几岁前都属于某个机构。多年以后，你会习惯这种归属感：一群人早上起床，去某些建筑里，做一些他们通常不喜欢做的事。属于这样的群体成了你的身份标签：姓名、年龄、角色、机构。如果你必须自我介绍，或者别人描述你时，会说 “约翰・史密斯，10 岁，某小学学生”，或者 “约翰・史密斯，20 岁，某大学学生”。</p>
<p>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it’s a lot like college. You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.</p>
<p>约翰・史密斯毕业后，人们期望他找一份工作。而找工作似乎意味着加入另一个机构。表面上看，这和大学很像：你挑选想为之工作的公司，申请加入。如果有一家公司喜欢你，你就成了这个新群体的一员。你早上起床，去新的建筑里，做一些你通常不喜欢做的事。有几个不同之处：生活没那么有趣，而且你会得到报酬，而不是像在大学时那样付钱。但相似之处似乎比不同之处更多。约翰・史密斯现在成了 “约翰・史密斯，22 岁，某公司软件开发者”。</p>
<p>In fact John Smith’s life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.</p>
<p>事实上，约翰・史密斯的生活变化比他意识到的要大。从社交角度看，公司和大学很像，但越深入底层现实，差异就越大。</p>
<p>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don’t make anything physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.</p>
<p>公司要做的（而且如果想继续存在就必须做的）是赚钱。大多数公司赚钱的方式是创造财富。公司可能非常专业化，以至于这种相似性被掩盖了，但不只是制造公司在创造财富。财富的一个重要组成部分是 “位置”。还记得那台能给你变出汽车、做晚餐等等的魔法机器吗？如果它把晚餐送到中亚的某个随机地点，就没那么有用了。如果财富是人们想要的东西，那么运输东西的公司也在创造财富。其他很多不制造实体产品的公司也是如此。几乎所有公司的存在都是为了做人们想要的事。</p>
<p>And that’s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people’s. You may not even be aware you’re doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won’t make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.</p>
<p>当你为一家公司工作时，你做的也是这件事。但这里有另一层因素掩盖了底层现实：在公司里，你的工作与很多其他人的工作被平均了。你甚至可能没意识到自己在做人们想要的事，你的贡献可能是间接的。但整个公司必须给人们提供他们想要的东西，否则就赚不到钱。如果公司每年付给你 x 美元，那么平均来看，你必须贡献至少 x 美元价值的工作，否则公司会入不敷出，最终倒闭。</p>
<p>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don’t need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It’s doing something people want that matters, not joining the group. [6]</p>
<p>大学毕业生会想（而且别人也会告诉他），他需要找一份工作，仿佛重要的是成为某个机构的一员。更直接的说法是：你需要开始做人们想要的事。你不需要加入公司才能做到这一点。公司只不过是一群人为了做人们想要的事而一起工作的组织。重要的是做人们想要的事，而不是加入这个群体。[6]</p>
<p>For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what’s happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.</p>
<p>对大多数人来说，最好的计划可能是为现有的公司工作。但理解你这么做时发生了什么是有好处的：工作意味着做人们想要的事，只不过是和公司里的其他人的工作平均在一起。</p>
<p><strong>Working Harder</strong></p>
<h3 id="更努力地工作"><a href="#更努力地工作" class="headerlink" title="更努力地工作"></a><strong>更努力地工作</strong></h3><p>That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person’s work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You’re expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you’re not expected to devote your whole life to your work.</p>
<p>这种 “平均” 成了一个问题。我认为大公司面临的最大问题是，很难衡量每个员工的工作价值。在很大程度上，他们只能敷衍了事。在大公司里，你努力工作，就能得到一份相当可预测的薪水。人们期望你不要明显无能或懒惰，但不期望你把全部生活都投入工作。</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.</p>
<p>然而，事实证明，你投入工作的时间多少，存在规模经济效应。在合适的行业里，一个全身心投入工作的人创造的财富，可能是普通员工的 10 倍甚至 100 倍。例如，一个程序员如果不只是慢慢维护和更新现有软件，而是编写一个全新的软件，就能创造新的收入来源。</p>
<p>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can’t go to your boss and say, I’d like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.</p>
<p>但公司的机制并不奖励想这么做的人。你不能走到老板面前说：“我想努力 10 倍，所以请付我 10 倍的薪水。” 一方面，官方的说法是你已经在尽最大努力工作了；但更严重的问题是，公司无法衡量你的工作价值。</p>
<p>Salesmen are an exception. It’s easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they’re usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.</p>
<p>销售人员是个例外。衡量他们创造的收入很容易，而且他们的报酬通常是收入的一定比例。如果销售人员想更努力工作，他可以直接开始做，报酬也会自动成比例增加。</p>
<p>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee’s performance can’t usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he’s done badly.</p>
<p>除了销售，大公司还有一种岗位能雇到顶尖人才：高层管理岗位。原因相同：他们的绩效可以被衡量。高层管理者要对整个公司的绩效负责。普通员工的绩效通常无法衡量，所以人们不期望他们付出更多，只需要扎实努力。而高层管理者和销售人员一样，必须拿出实际成果。如果公司业绩下滑，CEO 不能辩解说自己已经扎实努力了 —— 公司做得不好，就是他做得不好。</p>
<p>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.</p>
<p>一家能如此直接地给所有员工付薪的公司，会非常成功。很多员工如果能因此获得更多报酬，就会更努力工作。更重要的是，这样的公司会吸引那些想特别努力工作的人，从而击败竞争对手。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, companies can’t pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees’ work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it’s something they’ve got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget’s sales are due to each group’s efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There’s no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you’d find these factors were all blurred together.</p>
<p>不幸的是，公司不能像对待销售人员那样给所有员工付薪。销售人员是独立工作的，而大多数员工的工作是相互交织的。假设一家公司生产某种消费电子产品：工程师造出了功能可靠、有各种新特性的产品；工业设计师为它设计了漂亮的外壳；然后营销人员说服所有人这是他们必须拥有的东西。你怎么知道产品的销量有多少归功于每个团队的努力？或者，有多少归功于过去的产品为公司赢得的质量声誉？你无法理清所有这些贡献。即使你能读懂消费者的心思，也会发现这些因素都是交织在一起的。</p>
<p>If you want to go faster, it’s a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people’s. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable– and the rest of the group slows you down.</p>
<p>如果你想加快速度，那么当你的工作与大量其他人的工作交织在一起时，就是个问题。在大团队中，你的绩效无法单独衡量 —— 而且团队中的其他人会拖慢你的速度。</p>
<p><strong>Measurement and Leverage</strong></p>
<h3 id="衡量与杠杆"><a href="#衡量与杠杆" class="headerlink" title="衡量与杠杆"></a><strong>衡量与杠杆</strong></h3><p>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.</p>
<p>要致富，你需要处于一种同时具备 “衡量” 和 “杠杆” 的环境中。你需要处于一个能衡量你绩效的位置，否则无法通过多做工作来获得更多报酬。而且你必须有杠杆，也就是说，你做的决策能产生巨大影响。</p>
<p>Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.</p>
<p>仅有衡量是不够的。例如，血汗工厂里的计件工作有衡量，但没有杠杆。你的绩效被衡量，报酬也相应计算，但你没有决策空间。你唯一能做的决定是工作速度，而这可能最多只能让你的收入增加两三倍。</p>
<p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</p>
<p>同时具备衡量和杠杆的工作例子是电影的主角。你的绩效可以通过电影的票房来衡量，而你的表现能决定电影的成败，这就是杠杆。</p>
<p>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They’re measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.</p>
<p>CEO 也同时具备衡量和杠杆。他们的绩效通过公司的业绩来衡量，而他们的决策能让整个公司朝着某个方向发展，这就是杠杆。</p>
<p>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they’re out. If you’re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.</p>
<p>我认为，所有靠自己努力致富的人，都会处于一个同时具备衡量和杠杆的环境中。我能想到的所有人都是如此：CEO、电影明星、对冲基金经理、职业运动员。杠杆存在的一个很好的迹象是 “失败的可能性”。收益必须与风险平衡，所以如果有巨大的潜在收益，就一定有可怕的潜在损失。CEO、明星、基金经理和运动员都生活在 “达摩克利斯之剑” 下 —— 一旦表现下滑，就会被淘汰。如果你从事的工作感觉很安全，你就不会致富，因为如果没有风险，几乎可以肯定没有杠杆。</p>
<p>But you don’t have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.</p>
<p>但你不必成为 CEO 或电影明星才能处于这样的环境中。你只需要加入一个致力于解决难题的小团队。</p>
<p><strong>Smallness &#x3D; Measurement</strong></p>
<h3 id="小规模-可衡量"><a href="#小规模-可衡量" class="headerlink" title="小规模 &#x3D; 可衡量"></a><strong>小规模 &#x3D; 可衡量</strong></h3><p>If you can’t measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.</p>
<p>如果你无法衡量单个员工的工作价值，你可以接近这个目标：衡量小团队的工作价值。</p>
<p>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.</p>
<p>衡量员工创造的收入的一个层面是整个公司的层面。当公司规模小时，你就能相当接近地衡量单个员工的贡献。一家能存活的创业公司可能只有 10 名员工，这样你对个人努力的衡量误差就在 10 倍以内。</p>
<p>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one’s boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two differences: you’re not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you’re not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.</p>
<p>因此，创办或加入创业公司，是大多数人能接近 “对老板说‘我想努力 10 倍，所以请付我 10 倍薪水’” 的方式。有两个区别：你不是对老板说，而是直接对客户说（毕竟老板只是客户的代理）；而且你不是单独行动，而是和一小群同样有野心的人一起。</p>
<p>It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can’t be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it’s their work that yours is going to be averaged with.</p>
<p>通常来说，这会是一个团队。除了少数特殊工作（如演戏或写书），你不可能一个人组成一家公司。而且你共事的人最好很优秀，因为你的工作价值会和他们的平均在一起。</p>
<p>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.</p>
<p>大公司就像一艘由一千名划手驱动的巨型帆船。有两件事会拖慢帆船的速度：一是划手们看不到努力工作的结果；二是在一千人的团队中，划手的平均水平很可能就是普通水平。</p>
<p>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.</p>
<p>如果你从这艘大帆船上随机选出 10 个人，让他们自己驾一艘小船，他们可能会划得更快。他们既有胡萝卜（奖励）也有大棒（惩罚）来激励自己。一个精力充沛的划手会因为知道自己能对船速产生明显影响而受到鼓舞；而如果有人懒惰，其他人更可能注意到并抱怨。</p>
<p>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It’s a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.</p>
<p>但 10 人小船的真正优势，体现在当你把大帆船上最优秀的 10 名划手挑出来，让他们一起驾一艘船时。他们会拥有小团队带来的所有额外动力，更重要的是，通过挑选这么小的团队，你能得到最优秀的划手。每个人都会是前 1% 的水平。对他们来说，和一小群同行的工作平均在一起，比和所有人的平均在一起要好得多。</p>
<p>That’s the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.</p>
<p>这就是创业公司的真正意义。理想情况下，你和一群同样想比在大公司更努力工作、获得更多报酬的人一起奋斗。而且因为创业公司往往是由一群自我选择的、有野心的人创办的（他们至少通过声誉相互了解），其衡量的精确性比单纯的小规模更高。创业公司不只是 10 个人，而是 10 个像你一样的人。</p>
<p>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If anything, it’s more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select. You don’t want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.</p>
<p>史蒂夫・乔布斯曾说，创业公司的成败取决于最初的 10 名员工。我同意。甚至可以说，更像是最初的 5 名。小规模本身并不是创业公司成功的原因，而是小团队可以做到 “精选”。你想要的不是 “乡村式” 的小规模，而是 “全明星队式” 的小规模。</p>
<p>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole. So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.</p>
<p>团队越大，其平均成员的水平就越接近总体人口的平均水平。所以，在其他条件相同的情况下，大公司里的优秀人才很可能吃亏，因为他们的表现被其他人的较低表现拉低了。当然，其他条件往往不相同：优秀人才可能不在乎钱，或者更喜欢大公司的稳定性。但在乎钱的优秀人才，通常会更愿意离开，和一小群同行一起工作。</p>
<p><strong>Technology &#x3D; Leverage</strong></p>
<h3 id="技术-杠杆"><a href="#技术-杠杆" class="headerlink" title="技术 &#x3D; 杠杆"></a><strong>技术 &#x3D; 杠杆</strong></h3><p>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they’re small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.</p>
<p>创业公司为任何人提供了一种处于 “可衡量” 和 “有杠杆” 环境中的方式。它们因规模小而具备可衡量性，因通过发明新技术赚钱而具备杠杆。</p>
<p>What is technology? It’s technique. It’s the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That’s the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That’s leverage.</p>
<p>什么是技术？是技术方法，是我们做事的方式。当你发现一种新的做事方式时，它的价值会被所有使用它的人放大。这就像那句谚语说的 “授人以鱼不如授人以渔”。这就是创业公司与餐馆或理发店的区别：你炸薯条或剪头发，一次只能服务一个客户；而如果你解决了一个很多人关心的技术问题，你就帮助了所有使用你解决方案的人 —— 这就是杠杆。</p>
<p>If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can’t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.</p>
<p>纵观历史，大多数通过创造财富致富的人，都是通过开发新技术做到的。你不可能以足够快的速度炸薯条或剪头发来致富。1200 年让佛罗伦萨人富起来的，是他们发现了制造当时的高科技产品 —— 精细织布 —— 的新技术；1600 年让荷兰人富起来的，是他们发现了造船和航海技术，使他们能主导远东的海洋贸易。</p>
<p>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that’s valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don’t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.</p>
<p>幸运的是，小规模和解决难题之间存在天然的契合。技术的前沿变化很快：今天有价值的技术，可能几年后就一文不值。小公司更适合这种环境，因为它们没有层层官僚机构拖慢速度。此外，技术进步往往来自非正统的方法，而小公司受传统的约束更少。</p>
<p>Big companies can develop technology. They just can’t do it quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.</p>
<p>大公司也能开发技术，但就是快不起来。它们的规模让它们行动迟缓，而且无法奖励员工付出的非凡努力。因此，实际上，大公司只能在那些需要大量资本、让创业公司无法竞争的领域（如微处理器、发电厂或客机）开发技术。即便在这些领域，它们也严重依赖创业公司提供的组件和想法。</p>
<p>It’s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don’t seem to be about technology. McDonald’s, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald’s franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald’s franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.</p>
<p>生物技术或软件创业公司为解决棘手技术问题而存在，这很明显。但我认为，在那些看似与技术无关的行业中，情况也是如此。例如，麦当劳能发展壮大，是因为它设计了一套系统 —— 麦当劳特许经营模式 —— 这套系统可以在世界各地随意复制。麦当劳的特许经营受到极其精确的规则控制，几乎就像一个软件：“一次编写，到处运行”。沃尔玛也是如此。山姆・沃尔顿致富，不是因为他是零售商，而是因为他设计了一种新的商店模式。</p>
<p>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.</p>
<p>不仅在选择公司的总体目标时，而且在沿途的每个决策点，都要用 “难度” 作为指导。在 Viaweb，我们有一个经验法则：“跑上楼”。假设你是一个灵活的小个子，被一个又胖又壮的恶霸追赶。你打开一扇门，发现自己在楼梯口。你会上楼还是下楼？我说上楼。恶霸跑下楼可能和你一样快，但上楼时，他的体重会成为更大的劣势。上楼对你来说很难，但对他来说更难。</p>
<p>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we’d always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can’t follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem. And I’d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.</p>
<p>在实践中，这意味着我们故意去寻找难题。如果有两个功能可以添加到我们的软件中，两者的价值与难度之比相同，我们总会选择更难的那个。不仅因为它更有价值，还因为它更难。我们乐于迫使更大、更慢的竞争对手跟着我们越过艰难的领域。就像游击队一样，创业公司更喜欢山区的复杂地形，因为中央政府的军队无法跟上。我记得有好几次，我们在一整天都在与某个可怕的技术问题搏斗后筋疲力尽，但我会很高兴，因为对我们来说很难的事情，对竞争对手来说可能是不可能的。</p>
<p>This is not just a good way to run a startup. It’s what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry. If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he’ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop? That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? [7] And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they’ll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they’ll take away your market overnight. You’d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.</p>
<p>这不仅是经营创业公司的好方法，这就是创业公司的本质。风险投资家知道这一点，他们有一个说法：“进入壁垒”。如果你带着一个新想法去找风险投资家，请求投资，他首先会问的问题之一是：“其他人开发这个有多难？” 也就是说，你在自己和潜在的追赶者之间设置了多少艰难的障碍？[7] 而且你最好能有说服力地解释为什么你的技术难以复制。否则，一旦大公司注意到它，就会自己开发，凭借他们的品牌、资本和分销渠道，一夜之间夺走你的市场。你就会像在开阔地带被正规军抓住的游击队一样。</p>
<p>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can’t, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it’s an everyday thing for them. They’ll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented television. The reason you’ve never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it. [8] The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth’s reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.</p>
<p>设置进入壁垒的一种方式是通过专利，但专利可能提供不了多少保护。竞争对手通常能找到绕过专利的方法；如果绕不过，他们可能会直接侵权，然后等你来起诉。大公司不怕被起诉 —— 这对他们来说是家常便饭。他们会确保起诉他们既昂贵又耗时。你听说过菲洛・法恩斯沃思吗？他发明了电视。你没听说过他，是因为他的公司没有从电视中赚钱。[8] 赚钱的是 RCA，而法恩斯沃思的回报是长达十年的专利诉讼。</p>
<p>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that’s simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don’t need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. [9]</p>
<p>在这里，就像在很多情况下一样，最好的防御是主动进攻。如果你能开发出竞争对手根本无法复制的技术，你就不需要依赖其他防御手段。从选择一个难题开始，然后在每个决策点，都选择更难的选项。[9]</p>
<p><strong>The Catch(es)</strong></p>
<h3 id="陷阱"><a href="#陷阱" class="headerlink" title="陷阱"></a><strong>陷阱</strong></h3><p>If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it would be more fun. I don’t think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.</p>
<p>如果创业只是比普通员工更努力工作，然后按比例获得报酬，那创办创业公司显然是个好主意。在某种程度上，这会更有趣。我认为很多人不喜欢大公司的慢节奏、没完没了的会议、茶水间的闲聊、愚蠢的中层经理等等。</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can’t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can’t decide, for example, that you’d like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When you’re running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.</p>
<p>不幸的是，这里有几个陷阱。一是你无法选择自己想处于曲线的哪个点。例如，你不能决定自己想努力两三倍，然后获得相应的报酬。当你经营一家创业公司时，你的竞争对手会决定你要多努力工作 —— 而他们几乎都会做出同样的决定：尽你所能。</p>
<p>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you’re 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you’re 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble. It’s common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.</p>
<p>另一个陷阱是，报酬平均来看才与生产力成比例。正如我之前所说，任何公司的成功都有很大的随机乘数。所以实际上，情况不是 “你生产力是 30 倍，报酬也是 30 倍”，而是 “你生产力是 30 倍，报酬在 0 到 1000 倍之间”。如果平均值是 30 倍，中位数可能就是 0。大多数创业公司都会失败，而且不只是我们在互联网泡沫时期听说的那些 “狗粮门户网站”。一家创业公司可能正在开发真正好的产品，但开发时间稍长，资金耗尽，就不得不关门。</p>
<p>A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.</p>
<p>创业公司就像蚊子。熊能承受一击，螃蟹有盔甲保护，但蚊子的设计目的只有一个：得分。它不会在防御上浪费能量。蚊子作为一个物种的防御方式是数量众多，但这对单个蚊子来说没什么安慰。</p>
<p>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don’t generally know which of the two you’re going to get till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.</p>
<p>创业公司和蚊子一样，往往是 “要么全有，要么全无” 的命题。而且你通常要到最后一刻才知道自己会是哪一种。Viaweb 有好几次差点失败，我们的轨迹就像正弦波。幸运的是，我们在周期的顶端被收购了，但真的非常接近失败。当我们在加州拜访雅虎，商谈把公司卖给他们时，我们还得借一个会议室，向一位即将退出新一轮融资的投资者保证我们能活下去（我们需要这笔融资来维持运营）。</p>
<p>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb’s hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.</p>
<p>这种 “全有或全无” 的特性不是我们想要的。Viaweb 的黑客们都极其厌恶风险。如果有某种方式能让我们只拼命工作，然后获得相应报酬，而不掺杂任何 “彩票” 性质，我们会很高兴。我们宁愿有 100% 的机会得到 100 万美元，也不愿有 20% 的机会得到 1000 万美元 —— 尽管理论上后者的价值是前者的两倍。不幸的是，目前商业世界中没有这样的机会。</p>
<p>The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.</p>
<p>最接近的方式是在早期阶段卖掉你的创业公司，放弃潜在收益（和风险），换取一笔较小但有保证的回报。我们有过这样的机会，但当时愚蠢地错过了。在那之后，我们变得非常渴望被收购。在接下来的一年左右，只要有人对 Viaweb 表现出丝毫兴趣，我们就会试图把公司卖给他们。但没有人愿意买，所以我们不得不继续做下去。</p>
<p>It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.</p>
<p>在早期阶段收购我们本是很划算的，但进行收购的公司并不想捡便宜。大到足以收购创业公司的公司，通常也保守到足以让收购负责人（他们很可能是商学院出身、后期加入公司的人）在收购决策上更保守。他们宁愿为 “安全的选择” 多付钱。因此，收购一家成熟的创业公司（即使溢价很高），也比收购一家早期创业公司更容易。</p>
<p><strong>Get Users</strong></p>
<h3 id="获取用户"><a href="#获取用户" class="headerlink" title="获取用户"></a><strong>获取用户</strong></h3><p>I think it’s a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It’s also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client’s assets into one volatile stock?</p>
<p>我认为如果可能的话，被收购是个好主意。经营企业和发展企业是两回事。一旦达到稳定阶段，让大公司接手也无妨。从财务角度看，出售公司也更明智，因为这能让你实现多元化。如果一个财务顾问把客户的所有资产都投入一只波动剧烈的股票，你会怎么想？</p>
<p>How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you’d do if you didn’t intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.</p>
<p>如何让公司被收购？大多数情况下，你要做的和不打算出售公司时做的事情一样，比如盈利。但被收购本身也是一门艺术，我们花了很多时间试图掌握它。</p>
<p>Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don’t buy you now, you’ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.</p>
<p>潜在的收购方总会尽可能拖延。被收购的难点在于让他们采取行动。对大多数人来说，最强大的动机不是对收益的希望，而是对损失的恐惧。对潜在收购方来说，最强大的动机是担心竞争对手会收购你。正如我们发现的，这会让 CEO 们连夜赶路。第二大动机是担心：如果现在不收购你，你会继续快速成长，以后收购成本更高，甚至可能成为竞争对手。</p>
<p>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. You’d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.</p>
<p>在这两种情况下，归根结底都是 “用户”。你可能会认为，打算收购你的公司会做大量研究，自己判断你的技术有多有价值。根本不是这样。他们只看你有多少用户。</p>
<p>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you’ve created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren’t using your software, maybe it’s not just because you’re bad at marketing. Maybe it’s because you haven’t made what they want.</p>
<p>实际上，收购方假设客户知道谁拥有最好的技术。这并不像听起来那么愚蠢。用户是你创造了财富的唯一真正证明。财富是人们想要的东西，如果人们不使用你的软件，可能不只是因为你营销做得不好，还可能是因为你没有做出他们想要的东西。</p>
<p>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you’re not just trying to solve problems. You’re trying to solve problems that users care about.</p>
<p>风险投资家有一份需要警惕的危险信号清单，其中靠前的是 “被技术迷经营的公司，他们痴迷于解决有趣的技术问题，而不是让用户满意”。在创业公司里，你不只是要解决问题，还要解决用户关心的问题。</p>
<p>So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.</p>
<p>所以我认为，你应该像收购方那样，把用户作为检验标准。把创业公司视为一个优化问题，其绩效用用户数量来衡量。任何试图优化软件的人都知道，关键在于衡量。当你试图猜测程序哪里慢、如何让它更快时，几乎总是猜错。</p>
<p>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It’s what acquirers care about. It’s what revenues depend on. It’s what makes competitors unhappy. It’s what impresses reporters, and potential new users. Certainly it’s a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.</p>
<p>用户数量可能不是完美的检验标准，但会非常接近。这是收购方关心的，是收入的基础，是让竞争对手不快的原因，是给记者和潜在新用户留下深刻印象的东西。当然，无论你技术多娴熟，它都比你凭直觉判断 “哪些问题值得解决” 要好得多。</p>
<p>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly– taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you’re optimizing based on guesses.</p>
<p>把创业公司视为优化问题，还能帮助你避免风险投资家担心的另一个陷阱 —— 开发产品耗时过长。现在我们可以意识到，这是黑客们已经知道要避免的：过早优化。尽快推出 1.0 版本。在你有用户可以衡量之前，你的优化都是基于猜测。</p>
<p>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear “your call is important to us, please stay on the line,” do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?</p>
<p>你需要时刻牢记的核心原则是：财富就是人们想要的东西。如果你打算通过创造财富来致富，就必须知道人们想要什么。很少有企业真正注重让客户满意。你有多少次走进一家商店，或者给一家公司打电话时，心里隐隐感到一丝不安？当你听到 “您的来电对我们很重要，请耐心等待” 时，会觉得 “太好了，一切都会好起来” 吗？</p>
<p>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that’s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.</p>
<p>一家餐馆偶尔提供一份烤焦的晚餐，或许还能承受。但在技术领域，你 “烹饪” 出一份东西，所有人都得吃这一份。所以，你提供的东西与人们想要的东西之间的任何差距，都会被无限放大。你要么让所有客户满意，要么惹恼所有客户。你越能贴近人们的需求，创造的财富就越多。</p>
<p><strong>Wealth and Power</strong></p>
<h3 id="财富与权力"><a href="#财富与权力" class="headerlink" title="财富与权力"></a><strong>财富与权力</strong></h3><p>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</p>
<p>创造财富并非致富的唯一途径。在人类历史的大部分时间里，它甚至不是最常见的途径。直到几个世纪前，财富的主要来源还是矿山、奴隶与农奴、土地和牲畜，而快速获取这些财富的方式只有继承、婚姻、征服或没收。财富自然名声不佳。</p>
<p>Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world’s history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds’ lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.</p>
<p>两件事改变了这一切。首先是法治。在世界历史的大部分时间里，如果你好不容易积累了一笔财富，统治者或其爪牙总会想办法把它夺走。但在中世纪的欧洲，一些新的变化出现了：一个新的商人和制造商阶层开始在城镇聚集。[10] 他们联合起来，有能力对抗当地的封建领主。于是，在人类历史上第一次，恶霸们不再抢走 “书呆子” 的午餐钱了。这自然形成了强大的激励，或许也正是第二次重大变革 —— 工业化 —— 的主要原因。</p>
<p>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>关于工业革命的起因，已有大量论述。但可以肯定的是，一个必要（即便不是充分）条件是：让创造财富的人能够安心享受自己的财富。[11] 有一个证据可以说明这一点：那些试图回归旧模式的国家（如苏联），以及在较小程度上 20 世纪 60 年代至 70 年代初工党执政的英国，都发生了类似的情况。一旦剥夺了财富带来的激励，技术创新就会陷入停滞。</p>
<p>Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They’re willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they’re not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate boss that you can’t go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.</p>
<p>记住，从经济角度看，创业公司的本质是：一种 “我想更快地工作” 的宣言。你不想通过五十年的固定工资慢慢积累财富，而是想尽快完成这件事。因此，禁止你积累财富的政府，实际上是在命令你放慢工作节奏。他们愿意让你在五十年里赚 300 万美元，却不愿让你通过拼命工作在两年内做到这一点。这就像你无法走到公司老板面前说 “我想努力十倍，请付我十倍薪水” 一样 —— 只不过，这个 “老板” 你无法通过创办自己的公司来逃离。</p>
<p>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It’s that it tends not to happen at all. It’s only when you’re deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>工作节奏缓慢的问题，不仅在于技术创新的速度会变慢，更在于创新可能根本不会发生。只有当你刻意去寻找难题，以利用速度获得最大优势时，才会承担这类项目。开发新技术是件苦差事。正如爱迪生所说，它是 1% 的灵感加 99% 的汗水。没有财富的激励，没人愿意做这件事。工程师会为战斗机、月球火箭等 “酷炫” 项目拿普通薪水工作，但灯泡、半导体等更平凡的技术，必须靠企业家来开发。</p>
<p>Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.</p>
<p>创业公司并非只是过去几十年硅谷才有的新鲜事物。自从通过创造财富可以致富以来，所有以此致富的人都使用了本质相同的方法：衡量与杠杆 —— 衡量来自小团队协作，杠杆来自新技术的开发。1200 年的佛罗伦萨与如今的圣克拉拉（硅谷所在地），使用的是同一个配方。</p>
<p>Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.</p>
<p>理解这一点或许有助于回答一个重要问题：欧洲为何变得如此强大？是因为欧洲的地理优势吗？是因为欧洲人在种族上更优越吗？还是因为他们的宗教？答案（至少直接原因）可能是：欧洲人搭乘了一个强大的新思想浪潮 —— 允许那些赚大钱的人保留自己的财富。</p>
<p>Once you’re allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn’t have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn’t have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.</p>
<p>一旦允许人们这样做，想致富的人就可以通过创造财富而非掠夺来实现目标。由此带来的技术进步，不仅转化为财富，还转化为军事力量。隐形飞机的理论由一位苏联数学家提出，但由于苏联没有计算机产业，这一理论对他们而言始终只是理论 —— 他们没有足够快的硬件来执行计算，无法设计出实际的飞机。</p>
<p>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don’t let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.</p>
<p>从这个角度看，冷战与二战（以及近代史上的大多数战争）都传递了同一个教训：不要让由战士和政客组成的统治阶级打压企业家。让个人致富的方法，同样能让国家强大。让 “书呆子” 保住自己的午餐钱，你就能统治世界。</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is uninterruptability. Different kinds of work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.</p>
<p>[1] 创业公司能给你带来的一个宝贵特质，是<strong>不受干扰的工作状态</strong>。不同类型的工作有不同的 “时间量子”：校对文稿的人或许每 15 分钟被打断一次， productivity（生产力）也不会受太大影响；但黑客（程序员）的时间量子很长 —— 可能需要整整一小时，才能把一个问题 “加载” 进大脑。因此，人事部的人打电话来提醒你忘了填某张表格，造成的损失可能极大。</p>
<p>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.</p>
<p>这就是为什么当黑客从屏幕前转过身来回答你的问题时，会投来如此凶狠的目光 —— 他们脑海中那座巨大的 “纸牌屋” 正在摇摇欲坠。</p>
<p>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it’s next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).</p>
<p>仅仅是 “可能被打断” 的风险，就会让黑客不敢开始攻克难题。这也是他们倾向于在深夜工作的原因，也是为什么在格子间里几乎写不出优秀的软件（除非在深夜）。</p>
<p>One great advantage of startups is that they don’t yet have any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.</p>
<p>创业公司的一大优势在于，还没有那些会打断你的人。这里没有人事部，因此也就没有那些表格，更没人会为此给你打电话。</p>
<p>[2] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.</p>
<p>[2] 面对 “创业公司员工的生产力可能是大公司员工的 20 到 30 倍” 这一说法，大公司的高管们自然会想：我怎样才能让手下的人也做到这一点？答案很简单：<strong>按生产力给他们付薪</strong>。</p>
<p>Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?</p>
<p>大多数公司的内部运作就像共产主义国家。如果你信奉自由市场，为什么不把公司改造成一个自由市场呢？</p>
<p>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.</p>
<p>假设：当每个员工的薪酬与他们创造的财富成正比时，公司的利润能达到最大化。</p>
<p>[3] Until recently even governments sometimes didn’t grasp the distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their “wealth” by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.</p>
<p>[3] 直到最近，即便是政府有时也分不清金钱与财富的区别。亚当・斯密在《国富论》（第五篇第一章）中提到，有一些国家试图通过禁止黄金或白银出口来 “保护” 它们的 “财富”。但拥有更多的交换媒介（货币）并不会让一个国家更富有 —— 如果更多的钱追逐等量的物质财富，结果只会是物价上涨。</p>
<p>[4] There are many senses of the word “wealth,” not all of them material. I’m not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind. I’m writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word “wealth.” What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.</p>
<p>[4] “财富” 一词有很多含义，并非都与物质相关。我不想在这里深入探讨哲学层面的 “哪种财富才是真正的财富”，而是聚焦于一个特定的、偏技术层面的定义：<strong>人们愿意为之付钱的东西</strong>。这种财富值得研究，因为它能让你免于挨饿。而人们愿意为哪些东西付钱，取决于他们，而非你。</p>
<p>When you’re starting a business, it’s easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an “outdoor portal.” You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.</p>
<p>创业时，你很容易陷入一种误区：认为客户想要的是你喜欢的东西。互联网泡沫时期，我曾遇到一位女士，她因为喜欢户外活动，就创办了一个 “户外门户网站”。但你知道吗？如果你喜欢户外活动，应该创办的是数据恢复公司 —— 帮人找回崩溃硬盘里的数据。</p>
<p>What’s the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what’s valuable is least likely to coincide with other people’s.</p>
<p>这两者有什么关联？毫无关联。这恰恰是我的观点：如果你想创造财富（从 “不挨饿” 这个狭义的技术角度来说），就应该对任何以 “自己喜欢” 为核心的计划保持高度怀疑。在这类事情上，你对 “价值” 的判断最不可能与他人一致。</p>
<p>[5] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don’t make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a machine that’s broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.</p>
<p>[5] 在修复汽车的过程中，你可能会对环境造成微小破坏，从而让其他人变得 “微乎其微地更穷”。虽然环境成本应该被考虑在内，但这并不会让财富变成一场零和游戏。例如，如果你修理一台因某个零件松动而坏掉的机器，就是在不产生环境成本的情况下创造财富。</p>
<p>[5b] This essay was written before Firefox.</p>

<p>[6] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don’t be fooled by the surface similarities. You’ve gone from guest to servant. It’s possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say “authorized personnel only.” But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you’re not consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>[6] 很多人在二十出头时会感到迷茫和沮丧。大学时光似乎有趣得多 —— 当然是这样。不要被表面的相似性所迷惑：你已经从 “客人” 变成了 “仆人”。在这个新世界里依然可以找到乐趣，比如，你现在能走进那些标着 “仅限授权人员进入” 的门。但这种转变起初会让人震惊，如果你没有清醒地意识到这一点，冲击会更大。</p>
<p>[7] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn’t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.</p>
<p>[7] 当年风投问我们，其他创业公司需要多久才能复制我们的软件时，我们总回答 “他们可能根本做不到”。现在想来，这让我们显得要么天真，要么像骗子。</p>
<p>[8] Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the “inventor” of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company’s PR people worked hard to spread the story. If you don’t know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it’s because other companies made all the money.</p>
<p>[8] 很少有技术能明确归属于某一个发明者。因此，通常来说，如果你知道某样东西（电话、流水线、飞机、灯泡、晶体管）的 “发明者” 是谁，那是因为他们的公司从中赚了钱，并且公司的公关人员不遗余力地传播了这个故事。如果你不知道某样东西（汽车、电视、计算机、喷气发动机、激光）的发明者是谁，那是因为钱都被其他公司赚走了。</p>
<p>[9] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you’re trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you’re even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what’s the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>[9] 这是一个适用于生活的好原则：<strong>面对两个选择时，选更难的那个</strong>。比如，当你纠结于出去跑步还是在家看电视时，选跑步。这个原则之所以有效，可能是因为当两个选择中一个更难时，你会考虑另一个的唯一原因就是懒惰。你内心深处知道该做什么，而这个原则只是迫使你承认这一点。</p>
<p>[10] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.</p>
<p>[10] 中产阶级最早出现在意大利北部和低地国家（荷兰、比利时等）并非偶然 —— 这些地区没有强大的中央政府。这两个地区是当时最富有的地方，也成为文艺复兴文明辐射的双中心。如今它们不再扮演这一角色，是因为其他地方（如美国）更忠实地践行了它们发现的原则。</p>
<p>[11] It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn’t the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.</p>
<p>[11] 这或许确实是一个充分条件。但如果是这样，工业革命为何没有更早发生？有两个可能的（且不矛盾的）答案：（a）它确实发生过 —— 工业革命是一系列变革中的一次。（b）因为在中世纪的城镇中，垄断和行会制度最初延缓了新生产方式的发展。</p>
