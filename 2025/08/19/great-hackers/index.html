<p>July 2004</p>
<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)<br>（本文改编自 2004 年在 Oscon 大会上的演讲。）</p>
<p>A few months ago I finished a new book, and in reviews I keep noticing words like “provocative’’ and “controversial.’’ To say nothing of “idiotic.’’<br>几个月前我完成了一本新书，在书评中，我总能看到 “挑衅性的”“有争议的” 这类词，更别提 “愚蠢的” 了。</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to make the book controversial. I was trying to make it efficient. I didn’t want to waste people’s time telling them things they already knew. It’s more efficient just to give them the diffs. But I suppose that’s bound to yield an alarming book.<br>我并非有意让这本书引发争议，只是想让它更高效 —— 不想浪费读者的时间去讲他们已经知道的事，直接给出 “差异点” 会更高效。但我猜，这样写难免会让书显得 “扎眼”。</p>
<h3 id="Edisons"><a href="#Edisons" class="headerlink" title="Edisons"></a><strong>Edisons</strong></h3><p><strong>爱迪生们</strong></p>
<p>There’s no controversy about which idea is most controversial: the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a problem as we think.<br>书中最具争议的观点毫无争议：财富差异或许没我们想的那么大问题。</p>
<p>I didn’t say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a good thing. I said in some situations it might be a sign of good things. A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be a sign of a good thing– for example, that you’re recovering consciousness after being hit on the head.<br>我在书中并没有说财富差异本身是好事，而是说在某些情况下，它可能是好事的信号。剧烈头痛不是好事，但它可能意味着好事 —— 比如，你头部受击后正在恢复意识。</p>
<p>Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity. (In a society of one, they’re identical.) And that is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation in productivity, it’s probably not because everyone is Thomas Edison. It’s probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.<br>财富差异可能是生产力差异的体现（在只有一个人的社会里，两者是一回事）。而生产力差异几乎肯定是好事：如果一个社会的生产力毫无差异，大概率不是因为每个人都是托马斯・爱迪生，而是因为根本没有爱迪生那样的人。</p>
<p>In a low-tech society you don’t see much variation in productivity. If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than the worst? A factor of two? Whereas when you hand people a complex tool like a computer, the variation in what they can do with it is enormous.<br>在低技术社会，生产力差异不大。如果有一群游牧部落的人捡柴生火，最能干的捡柴人比最差的能强多少？两倍？但当你给人们一台像电脑这样复杂的工具时，他们用它能做出的成果差异就大得惊人了。</p>
<p>That’s not a new idea. Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and the study he quoted was published in 1968. But I think he underestimated the variation between programmers. He wrote about productivity in lines of code: the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth the time. But what if the problem isn’t given? In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. Imagination is hard to measure, but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that’s measured in lines of code.<br>这不是什么新观点。弗雷德・布鲁克斯在 1974 年就写过相关内容，他引用的研究发表于 1968 年。但我觉得他低估了程序员之间的差异。他用代码行数衡量生产力：最优秀的程序员解决特定问题的时间是其他人的十分之一。但如果问题不是 “给定的” 呢？在编程领域，和许多其他领域一样，难的不是解决问题，而是决定要解决什么问题。想象力难以衡量，但实际上，它对生产力的影响远超过代码行数这种衡量方式。</p>
<p>Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it varies so much. The variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind. I don’t think this is something intrinsic to programming, though. In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity. I think what’s happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological leverage. But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on. And the success of companies, and countries, will depend increasingly on how they deal with it.<br>任何领域都存在生产力差异，但很少有领域的差异大到这种程度。程序员之间的差异如此显著，甚至成了 “质” 的不同。不过我不认为这是编程本身固有的特性。在所有领域，技术都会放大生产力差异。编程领域的情况只是因为我们拥有强大的技术杠杆。但每个领域的 “杠杆” 都在变长，所以这种差异会随着时间推移出现在越来越多的领域。公司乃至国家的成功，将越来越取决于它们如何应对这种差异。</p>
<p>If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time. When you reach the point where 90% of a group’s output is created by 1% of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids, or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.<br>如果生产力差异随技术发展而扩大，那么最高效个体的贡献不仅会大得不成比例，还会随时间增长。当一个群体 90% 的产出来自 1% 的成员时，若有什么因素（无论是维京人的劫掠，还是中央计划）把这些人的生产力拉到平均水平，损失就太大了。</p>
<p>If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these especially productive people. What motivates them? What do they need to do their jobs? How do you recognize them? How do you get them to come and work for you? And then of course there’s the question, how do you become one?<br>如果想充分发挥他们的潜力，我们需要理解这些高效个体：他们的动力是什么？工作需要什么条件？如何识别他们？如何让他们来为你工作？当然，还有一个问题：如何成为他们中的一员？</p>
<h3 id="More-than-Money"><a href="#More-than-Money" class="headerlink" title="More than Money"></a><strong>More than Money</strong></h3><p><strong>不止是钱</strong></p>
<p>I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about what they have in common. Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program. Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills. Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they’re delighted to find people will pay them for.<br>我认识几个超级黑客，于是坐下来思考他们的共同点。他们最显著的特质或许是真心热爱编程。普通程序员写代码是为了谋生，而优秀的黑客则视编程为乐趣，能靠这个赚钱还让他们很开心。</p>
<p>Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money. This isn’t quite true. It is true that all they really care about is doing interesting work. But if you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money. But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for it.<br>人们有时说优秀的程序员对金钱漠不关心，这并不完全对。他们确实只在乎做有趣的工作，但如果你赚了足够多的钱，就能做任何想做的事 —— 因此黑客们其实也向往赚大钱。但只要还得每天上班，他们就更在乎工作内容，而非报酬多少。</p>
<p>Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because it means you don’t have to pay great hackers anything like what they’re worth. A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times as productive as an ordinary one, but he’ll consider himself lucky to get paid three times as much. As I’ll explain later, this is partly because great hackers don’t know how good they are. But it’s also because money is not the main thing they want.<br>从经济角度看，这一点极其重要：你不必按优秀黑客的实际价值付薪。一个优秀程序员的生产力可能是普通程序员的 10 倍甚至 100 倍，但如果能拿到 3 倍工资，他就觉得很幸运了。后面我会解释，部分原因是优秀黑客不知道自己有多厉害，更重要的是，钱不是他们最想要的。</p>
<p>What do hackers want? Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools. In fact, that’s an understatement. Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. They’ll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.<br>黑客想要什么？和所有工匠一样，他们喜欢好工具。其实这么说都太保守了。优秀的黑客无法忍受用烂工具，遇到基础设施不行的项目，他们会直接拒绝参与。</p>
<p>At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our bulletin board was an ad from IBM. It was a picture of an AS400, and the headline read, I think, “hackers despise it.’’ [1]<br>我曾工作过的一家创业公司，布告栏上贴过一张 IBM 的广告，上面是 AS400 的图片，标题我记得是 “黑客鄙视它”。[1]</p>
<p>When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you’re not just making a technical decision. You’re also making a social decision, and this may be the more important of the two. For example, if your company wants to write some software, it might seem a prudent choice to write it in Java. But when you choose a language, you’re also choosing a community. The programmers you’ll be able to hire to work on a Java project won’t be as smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python. And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you choose. Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages.<br>为项目选择基础设施时，你不只是做技术决策，更是在做社会决策 —— 后者可能更重要。比如，公司要开发软件，用 Java 似乎是稳妥的选择。但选择编程语言时，你也在选择一个社区。能雇来做 Java 项目的程序员，可能不如能雇来做 Python 项目的聪明。而黑客的质量，可能比编程语言的选择更重要。不过说实话，优秀黑客更喜欢 Python 而非 Java，这本身就说明了两种语言的相对优劣。</p>
<p>Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards. They don’t want to bet the company on Betamax. The thing about languages, though, is that they’re not just standards. If you have to move bits over a network, by all means use TCP&#x2F;IP. But a programming language isn’t just a format. A programming language is a medium of expression.<br>商界人士喜欢最流行的语言，因为他们视语言为标准，不想把公司押在 “Beta 制大尺寸磁带”（指小众标准）上。但语言不只是标准。如果要在网络上传输数据，用 TCP&#x2F;IP 没问题，但编程语言不只是一种格式，它是一种表达媒介。</p>
<p>I’ve read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular language. As a standard, you couldn’t wish for more. But as a medium of expression, you could do a lot better. Of all the great programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily program in Java. And of all the great programmers I can think of who don’t work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.<br>我看到报道说 Java 刚超过 Cobol 成为最流行的语言。作为标准，它无可挑剔，但作为表达媒介，还有很大提升空间。在我能想到的所有优秀程序员中，只有一个人会自愿用 Java 编程。而在那些不为 Sun 公司工作、不做 Java 相关项目的优秀程序员里，这个数字是零。</p>
<p>Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software. Not just because it’s better, but because it gives them more control. Good hackers insist on control. This is part of what makes them good hackers: when something’s broken, they need to fix it. You want them to feel this way about the software they’re writing for you. You shouldn’t be surprised when they feel the same way about the operating system.<br>优秀的黑客通常还坚持用开源软件，不仅因为开源更好，还因为它能给他们更多控制权。优秀的黑客执着于掌控 —— 这也是他们优秀的原因之一：东西坏了，他们就得修好。你希望他们对给你写的软件有这种态度，那么他们对操作系统有同样的态度，也不足为奇。</p>
<p>A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new startup he was involved with. It sounded promising. But the next time I talked to him, he said they’d decided to build their software on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer to be their chief technical officer. When I heard this, I thought, these guys are doomed. One, the CTO couldn’t be a first rate hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn’t imagine a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he’d have a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had to be built on NT. [2]<br>几年前，一个风投朋友跟我说他参与的一家新创业公司，听起来很有前景。但下次见面时，他说他们决定基于 Windows NT 开发软件，还雇了一个经验丰富的 NT 开发者当首席技术官。我一听就觉得，这公司完了。一来，这个 CTO 不可能是一流黑客 —— 要成为知名的 NT 开发者，就得自愿多次使用 NT，而我无法想象优秀的黑客会这么做；二来，就算他很厉害，项目要基于 NT 开发，也很难招到优秀的人。[2]</p>
<h3 id="The-Final-Frontier"><a href="#The-Final-Frontier" class="headerlink" title="The Final Frontier"></a><strong>The Final Frontier</strong></h3><p><strong>最后的前沿</strong></p>
<p>After software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably his office. Big companies think the function of office space is to express rank. But hackers use their offices for more than that: they use their office as a place to think in. And if you’re a technology company, their thoughts are your product. So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot.<br>除了软件，黑客最重要的工具可能是他的办公室。大公司认为办公空间的作用是彰显等级，但黑客对办公室的使用不止于此 —— 他们把办公室当作思考的地方。如果你是科技公司，他们的想法就是你的产品。所以让黑客在嘈杂、易分心的环境中工作，就像在油漆厂让空气里满是煤烟。</p>
<p>The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with good reason. All the hackers I know despise them. The mere prospect of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on hard problems. If you want to get real work done in an office with cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or late or on a weekend, when no one else is there. Don’t companies realize this is a sign that something is broken? An office environment is supposed to be something that helps you work, not something you work despite.<br>漫画《呆伯特》里对隔间有很多吐槽，这是有道理的。我认识的所有黑客都鄙视隔间。仅仅是可能被打扰，就足以让黑客无法解决难题。如果想在有隔间的办公室里真正完成工作，只有两个选择：在家工作，或者在其他人不在的时候（早到、晚走、周末）来公司。公司难道没意识到这说明哪里出问题了吗？办公环境本该是助力工作的，而不是需要克服的障碍。</p>
<p>Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle, even the CEO. But they’re not so advanced as they think; obviously they still view office space as a badge of rank. Note too that Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house. They get new technology by buying the startups that created it– where presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.<br>像思科这样的公司，会为 “包括 CEO 在内所有人都用隔间” 而自豪，但他们并没有自己想的那么先进 —— 显然他们仍把办公空间当作等级的象征。还要注意，思科以很少在内部做产品开发闻名，他们通过收购创造新技术的创业公司来获取技术 —— 而那些创业公司里的黑客，想必有安静的地方工作。</p>
<p>One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft. I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a door. Work for us, the premise was, and we’ll give you a place to work where you can actually get work done. And you know, Microsoft is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop software in house. Not well, perhaps, but well enough.<br>有一家大公司懂黑客的需求，那就是微软。我曾见过微软的招聘广告，上面是一扇门的大图，大意是：来为我们工作，我们给你一个能真正完成工作的地方。要知道，在大公司里，微软能在内部开发软件是很厉害的 —— 或许做得不算顶尖，但足够好了。</p>
<p>If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at what they do at home. At home, hackers can arrange things themselves so they can get the most done. And when they work at home, hackers don’t work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors. They work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass boxes set in acres of parking lots. They have a sofa they can take a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at their desk, pretending to work. There’s no crew of people with vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime hacking hours. There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate retreats or team-building exercises. And when you look at what they’re doing on that computer, you’ll find it reinforces what I said earlier about tools. They may have to use Java and Windows at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you’re more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.<br>如果公司想让黑客高效工作，应该看看他们在家怎么做。在家时，黑客会自己安排环境以高效工作：他们不在嘈杂的开放空间工作，而是在带门的房间；在舒适、有邻里感的地方工作，周围有人，想琢磨事情时能散步，而不是在停车场环绕的玻璃盒子里；累了能在沙发上小睡，而不是在办公桌前昏昏沉沉地假装工作；没有清洁工在晚上的黄金编程时间轰隆隆地用吸尘器；没有会议，更别提公司团建或拓展了。再看他们在家用电脑做什么，会印证我之前说的工具问题：他们在工作中可能不得不使用 Java 和 Windows，但在家能自主选择时，更可能用 Perl 和 Linux。</p>
<p>Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular language can be misleading. What we ought to look at, if we want to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can choose freely– that is, in projects of their own. When you ask that question, you find that open source operating systems already have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably Perl.<br>其实，Cobol 或 Java 是最流行语言的统计数据可能有误导性。如果想知道什么工具最好，应该看黑客在能自由选择时 —— 也就是在自己的项目中 —— 会选什么。这时你会发现，开源操作系统已占据主导地位，而最受欢迎的语言可能是 Perl。</p>
<h3 id="Interesting"><a href="#Interesting" class="headerlink" title="Interesting"></a><strong>Interesting</strong></h3><p><strong>有趣的事</strong></p>
<p>Along with good tools, hackers want interesting projects. What makes a project interesting? Well, obviously overtly sexy applications like stealth planes or special effects software would be interesting to work on. But any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges. So it’s hard to predict which problems hackers will like, because some become interesting only when the people working on them discover a new kind of solution. Before ITA (who wrote the software inside Orbitz), the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it was one of the most boring applications imaginable. But ITA made it interesting by redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.<br>除了好工具，黑客还想要有趣的项目。什么让项目有趣？显然，像隐形飞机或特效软件这样 “酷炫” 的应用会很有趣，但任何应用只要有新颖的技术挑战，就可能变得有趣。所以很难预测黑客会喜欢什么问题，因为有些问题只有在解决者找到新解法时才变得有趣。在 ITA（Orbitz 的内部软件开发者）之前，做机票价格搜索的人可能觉得这是最无聊的应用之一，但 ITA 通过更有野心地重新定义问题，让它变得有趣了。</p>
<p>I think the same thing happened at Google. When Google was founded, the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search was boring and unimportant. But the guys at Google didn’t think search was boring, and that’s why they do it so well.<br>谷歌的情况也类似。谷歌成立时，所谓的门户网站普遍认为搜索既无聊又不重要，但谷歌的人不觉得搜索无聊，所以他们才能做得这么好。</p>
<p>This is an area where managers can make a difference. Like a parent saying to a child, I bet you can’t clean up your whole room in ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a more interesting one. Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at this, in part simply by having high standards. There were a lot of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac. He redefined the problem as: make one that’s beautiful. And that probably drove the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.<br>这是管理者能发挥作用的地方。就像家长对孩子说 “我打赌你十分钟内收拾不好整个房间”，优秀的管理者有时能把问题重新定义得更有趣。史蒂夫・乔布斯在这方面尤其擅长，部分原因是他标准极高。在 Mac 之前，有很多小型廉价电脑，他把问题重新定义为 “做一台漂亮的电脑”，这对开发者的驱动力可能比任何奖惩都强。</p>
<p>They certainly delivered. When the Mac first appeared, you didn’t even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell from the case. A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in Cambridge, and in someone’s trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac carrying case. I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE. I carried it home and plugged it in, and it booted. The happy Macintosh face, and then the finder. My God, it was so simple. It was just like … Google.<br>他们确实做到了。Mac 刚出现时，甚至不用开机就知道它很棒，从外壳就能看出来。几周前我在剑桥的街上走，在别人的垃圾桶里看到一个像是 Mac 的包，打开一看是一台 Mac SE。我带回家插上电，它启动了 —— 出现了苹果的笑脸，然后是 finder 界面。天啊，太简单了，就像…… 谷歌。</p>
<p>Hackers like to work for people with high standards. But it’s not enough just to be exacting. You have to insist on the right things. Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself. I’ve seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you’re not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up.<br>黑客喜欢为高标准的人工作，但光严格还不够，必须坚持对的事 —— 这通常意味着你自己也得是黑客。我偶尔会看到关于 “如何管理程序员” 的文章，其实应该分两篇：一篇给本身是程序员的管理者，一篇给不是的。后者或许可以浓缩成两个字：放弃。</p>
<p>The problem is not so much the day to day management. Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The problem is, if you’re not a hacker, you can’t tell who the good hackers are. A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don’t have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer? By definition you can’t tell from his portfolio. And you can’t go by the awards he’s won or the jobs he’s had, because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third. There’s no way around it: you can’t manage a process intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is. American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.<br>问题不在于日常管理 —— 真正优秀的黑客几乎能自我管理。问题是，如果你不是黑客，就无法识别谁是优秀的黑客。类似的问题解释了为什么美国车这么丑，我称之为 “设计悖论”。你可能觉得雇个伟大的设计师就能做出漂亮的产品，但如果你自己审美不行，怎么识别优秀的设计师？按理说，你从他的作品集里看不出来，也不能看他得过什么奖或做过什么工作 —— 因为在设计领域，和多数领域一样，这些往往由潮流和人脉驱动，实际能力排第三。没办法：如果不知道 “美” 是什么，就无法管理一个旨在产出美的过程。美国车丑，是因为美国汽车公司的管理者审美差。</p>
<p>Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive, or even frivolous. It is neither. To drive design, a manager must be the most demanding user of a company’s products. And if you have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying you the kind of problem that good people like to work on.<br>这个国家很多人认为审美难以捉摸，甚至无关紧要，其实都不是。要推动设计，管理者必须是公司产品最挑剔的用户。如果你真的很有审美，就能像乔布斯那样，让 “满足你” 成为优秀人才愿意为之努力的问题。</p>
<h3 id="Nasty-Little-Problems"><a href="#Nasty-Little-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Nasty Little Problems"></a><strong>Nasty Little Problems</strong></h3><p><strong>讨厌的小问题</strong></p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones. One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that’s full of bugs. Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client’s complex and ill-defined needs. To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts.<br>很容易说哪些问题不有趣：不是解决几个大而清晰的问题，而是要解决一堆讨厌的小问题。最糟糕的项目之一是给充满漏洞的软件写接口，另一个是为个别客户复杂且模糊的需求定制东西。对黑客来说，这类项目是 “千刀万剐” 式的折磨。</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don’t learn anything from them. Writing a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is. But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software doesn’t teach you anything, because the bugs are random. [3] So it’s not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems. It’s more a question of self-preservation. Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.<br>讨厌的小问题的特点是，你从中学不到任何东西。写编译器很有趣，因为能让你理解编译器是什么，但给有漏洞的软件写接口学不到东西，因为漏洞是随机的。[3] 所以优秀的黑客避开这些小问题，不只是因为挑剔，更是自我保护 —— 做这些事会让人变蠢。优秀黑客避开它们，就像模特避开芝士汉堡一样。</p>
<p>Of course some problems inherently have this character. And because of supply and demand, they pay especially well. So a company that found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would be very successful. How would you do it?<br>当然，有些问题本身就有这种特质，而且因为供需关系，报酬特别高。所以如果公司能让优秀黑客去做枯燥的问题，会非常成功。怎么做呢？</p>
<p>One place this happens is in startups. At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator. That’s like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah. You can’t hire that kind of talent. But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they’re the founders. [4]<br>创业公司里会有这种情况。我们创业时，罗伯特・莫里斯做系统管理员，这就像让滚石乐队在成人礼上表演 —— 你雇不来这种人才，但创始人会为自己的公司做任何枯燥的事。[4]</p>
<p>Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company. They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&amp;D department where employees don’t have to work directly on customers’ nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research department functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe the rest of the company will be able to use them.<br>大公司通过拆分公司来解决这个问题：设立独立的研发部门，让员工不用直接处理客户那些讨厌的小问题，以此吸引聪明人。[5] 在这种模式下，研发部门就像矿场，产出新想法，公司其他部门或许能用上。</p>
<p>You may not have to go to this extreme. Bottom-up programming suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people work as toolmakers. If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications. This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code, but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department. The toolmakers would have users, but they’d only be the company’s own developers. [6]<br>或许不用这么极端。自底向上的编程方式提供了另一种拆分方式：让聪明人做工具制造者。如果公司做 x 类软件，就分一组人开发写这类软件的工具，另一组用这些工具写应用。这样，聪明人可能写出 99% 的代码，同时几乎像在传统研发部门一样不受用户干扰 —— 工具制造者有用户，但只有公司自己的开发者。[6]</p>
<p>If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn’t be so full of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual applications wouldn’t be doing low-level stuff like allocating memory. Instead of writing Word directly in C, they’d be plugging together big Lego blocks of Word-language. (Duplo, I believe, is the technical term.)<br>如果微软用这种方式，他们的软件就不会有这么多安全漏洞，因为写实际应用的不那么聪明的人就不用做内存分配之类的底层工作。他们不会直接用 C 写 Word，而是把 “Word 语言” 的大乐高积木拼起来（我觉得技术上应该叫 “得宝”）。</p>
<h3 id="Clumping"><a href="#Clumping" class="headerlink" title="Clumping"></a><strong>Clumping</strong></h3><p><strong>聚集</strong></p>
<p>Along with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other good hackers. Great hackers tend to clump together– sometimes spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc. So you won’t attract good hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create for them. The tendency to clump means it’s more like the square of the environment. So it’s winner take all. At any given time, there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to work, and if you aren’t one of them, you won’t just have fewer great hackers, you’ll have zero.<br>除了有趣的问题，优秀的黑客还喜欢其他优秀的黑客。伟大的黑客往往聚集在一起 —— 有时非常显著，比如施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心。所以你为他们创造的环境有多好，吸引优秀黑客的数量并非线性增长，聚集效应意味着更接近环境质量的平方关系。因此是赢家通吃：任何时候，只有十来个或二十来个地方是黑客最想去的，如果你不在其中，就不只是优秀黑客少，而是一个都没有。</p>
<p>Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company successful. It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of the hot spots right now, but it didn’t help Thinking Machines or Xerox. Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model is a down elevator. In that situation, even the best hackers can’t save you.<br>有优秀的黑客本身并不足以让公司成功。谷歌和 ITA 现在是热门，这招对它们有用，但对 “思维机器” 公司或施乐没用。太阳微系统公司曾辉煌过，但商业模式走下坡路时，再好的黑客也救不了。</p>
<p>I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage. There are people who would disagree with this. When we were making the rounds of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software companies didn’t win by writing great software, but through brand, and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.<br>但我认为，在其他条件相同的情况下，能吸引优秀黑客的公司会有巨大优势。有人不同意这种说法。20 世纪 90 年代我们去风投公司融资时，有几家说软件公司的成功不靠写优秀软件，而靠品牌、渠道主导和做对交易。</p>
<p>They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why. I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. And of course if Microsoft is your model, you shouldn’t be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software. But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM.<br>他们似乎真的相信这一点，我觉得我知道原因：很多风投至少潜意识里在找下一个微软。当然，如果以微软为榜样，就不该找那些希望靠写优秀软件取胜的公司。但风投找下一个微软是错的，因为除非有另一家公司准备好在恰当时刻 “弯腰” 成为下一个 IBM，否则没有创业公司能成为下一个微软。</p>
<p>It’s a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole culture derives from that one lucky break. Microsoft is a bad data point. If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend to win in the market. What VCs should be looking for is the next Apple, or the next Google.<br>以微软为榜样是错的，因为他们的整个文化都源于那次幸运的突破。微软是个不好的例子。抛开它，你会发现好产品往往能在市场上胜出。风投应该找的是下一个苹果，或下一个谷歌。</p>
<p>I think Bill Gates knows this. What worries him about Google is not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have better hackers. [7]<br>我觉得比尔・盖茨明白这一点。谷歌让他担心的不是品牌影响力，而是谷歌有更优秀的黑客。[7]</p>
<h3 id="Recognition"><a href="#Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Recognition"></a><strong>Recognition</strong></h3><p><strong>识别</strong></p>
<p>So who are the great hackers? How do you know when you meet one? That turns out to be very hard. Even hackers can’t tell. I’m pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway. The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally).<br>那么，谁是优秀的黑客？遇到时怎么识别？这其实很难，连黑客自己都分不清。我现在很确定我的朋友特雷弗・布莱克韦尔是优秀的黑客。你可能在 Slashdot 上看到过他自己做赛格威的事，这个项目了不起的是，他一天就写完了所有软件（顺便说一句，用的是 Python）。</p>
<p>For Trevor, that’s par for the course. But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot. He was standing in Robert Morris’s office babbling at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch. Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too. Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere. He’d also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.<br>对特雷弗来说，这很平常。但我第一次见他时，觉得他是个彻头彻尾的白痴。他站在罗伯特・莫里斯的办公室里，对着罗伯特喋喋不休，我记得我站在他身后，疯狂地给罗伯特打手势，想把这个疯子赶出去好去吃午饭。罗伯特说他一开始也看错了特雷弗。显然，罗伯特第一次见他时，特雷弗刚搞了个新名堂：把生活方方面面的事都写在一叠索引卡上，走到哪带到哪。他刚从加拿大来，带着浓重的加拿大口音，留着胭脂鱼发型。</p>
<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their reputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of effort into seeming smart. When I was in grad school I used to hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating at first. Everyone there spoke so fast. But after a while I learned the trick of speaking fast. You don’t have to think any faster; just use twice as many words to say everything.<br>更麻烦的是，尽管黑客以不懂社交闻名，有时却会费尽心机显得聪明。我读研究生时偶尔去麻省理工学院人工智能实验室逛，一开始有点吓人，那里的人说话都超快。但过了一阵子，我学会了说话快的诀窍：不用想更快，只要说每件事都用两倍的词就行。</p>
<p>With this amount of noise in the signal, it’s hard to tell good hackers when you meet them. I can’t tell, even now. You also can’t tell from their resumes. It seems like the only way to judge a hacker is to work with him on something.<br>信号里有这么多噪音，见面时很难判断谁是优秀的黑客，我现在也做不到。从简历里也看不出来。似乎只有和他一起做件事才能判断。</p>
<p>And this is the reason that high-tech areas only happen around universities. The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students. Startups grow up around universities because universities bring together promising young people and make them work on the same projects. The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own.<br>这就是高科技区域只出现在大学周边的原因。关键因素与其说是教授，不如说是学生。创业公司在大学周边成长，因为大学把有潜力的年轻人聚集起来，让他们一起做项目。聪明的人会知道谁和自己一样聪明，然后一起搞新项目。</p>
<p>Because you can’t tell a great hacker except by working with him, hackers themselves can’t tell how good they are. This is true to a degree in most fields. I’ve found that people who are great at something are not so much convinced of their own greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.<br>因为只有一起工作才能识别优秀的黑客，所以黑客自己也不知道自己有多厉害。多数领域都有这种情况。我发现，在某方面很厉害的人，与其说是确信自己很厉害，不如说是困惑于为什么其他人看起来这么无能。</p>
<p>But it’s particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are, because it’s hard to compare their work. This is easier in most other fields. In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who’s fastest. Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good solution. But hacking is like writing. Who can say which of two novels is better? Certainly not the authors.<br>但黑客尤其难知道自己有多厉害，因为他们的工作很难比较。多数其他领域更简单：百米赛跑 10 秒内就知道谁最快；甚至数学领域，大家对哪些问题难、什么是好解法也有共识。但编程就像写作，谁能说两本小说哪本更好？作者肯定说不出来。</p>
<p>With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. That’s because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back. But hackers can’t watch themselves at work. So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he’s almost certain to reply, I don’t know. He’s not just being modest. He really doesn’t know.<br>但至少其他黑客能判断谁是优秀的黑客，因为和小说家不同，黑客会合作项目。当你通过网络向某人抛出几个难题，很快就知道他能回击得多有力。但黑客看不到自己的工作状态，所以如果你问优秀的黑客他有多厉害，他几乎肯定会说 “不知道”—— 这不是谦虚，是真不知道。</p>
<p>And none of us know, except about people we’ve actually worked with. Which puts us in a weird situation: we don’t know who our heroes should be. The hackers who become famous tend to become famous by random accidents of PR. Occasionally I need to give an example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use. The first names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally, but it seems lame to use them. So, I think, maybe I should say Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous like that. But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers. I’ve never worked with them on anything.<br>除了和我们一起工作过的人，我们谁也不了解，这让我们陷入一种奇怪的境地：不知道该以谁为榜样。出名的黑客往往是因为公关偶然事件才出名。我偶尔需要举一个优秀黑客的例子，却不知道选谁。脑子里最先冒出来的总是认识的人，但用他们又显得没说服力。所以我想，或许该说理查德・斯托曼、莱纳斯・托瓦兹、艾伦・凯之类的名人，但我不知道他们是不是优秀的黑客 —— 我从没和他们一起做过事。</p>
<p>If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him.<br>如果编程界有 “迈克尔・乔丹”，没人知道是谁，包括他自己。</p>
<h3 id="Cultivation"><a href="#Cultivation" class="headerlink" title="Cultivation"></a><strong>Cultivation</strong></h3><p><strong>培养</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about: how do you become a great hacker? I don’t know if it’s possible to make yourself into one. But it’s certainly possible to do things that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you can probably make yourself smart too.<br>最后，是所有黑客都想知道的问题：如何成为优秀的黑客？我不知道能不能把自己变成这样的人，但肯定能做些让自己变蠢的事 —— 如果能变蠢，或许也能变聪明。</p>
<p>The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like. When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have in common is the extreme difficulty of making them work on anything they don’t want to. I don’t know if this is cause or effect; it may be both.<br>成为优秀黑客的关键可能是做自己喜欢的事。想到我认识的优秀黑客，他们的共同点是：很难让他们做不想做的事。我不知道这是原因还是结果，或许两者都是。</p>
<p>To do something well you have to love it. So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love, you’re likely to do it well. Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at age 14. If you’re worried that your current job is rotting your brain, it probably is.<br>要做好一件事，必须热爱它。所以，只要能保持对编程的热爱，你就可能做得很好。试着保留 14 岁时对编程的那种好奇。如果你担心现在的工作会让你变蠢，那很可能确实如此。</p>
<p>The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that’s true in a lot of fields. Is there some quality that’s unique to hackers? I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was curiosity. I’d always supposed that all smart people were curious– that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge. But apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how things work. That makes sense, because programs are in effect giant descriptions of how things work.<br>当然，最优秀的黑客往往很聪明，但很多领域都是如此。有没有黑客独有的特质？我问了些朋友，他们提到最多的是好奇心。我一直以为所有聪明人都好奇 —— 好奇心不过是知识的一阶导数。但显然黑客尤其好奇，特别是对事物的原理。这说得通，因为程序本质上是对事物原理的详细描述。</p>
<p>Several friends mentioned hackers’ ability to concentrate– their ability, as one put it, to “tune out everything outside their own heads.’’ I’ve certainly noticed this. And I’ve heard several hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can’t program at all. So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus. Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just that line but the whole program around it. John McPhee wrote that Bill Bradley’s success as a basketball player was due partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision. “Perfect’’ eyesight means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision. Bill Bradley had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor. Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability. (I cheat by using a very dense language, which shrinks the court.)<br>几个朋友提到了黑客的专注力 —— 用其中一个人的话说，是 “屏蔽脑海外所有东西” 的能力。我确实注意到了这一点。还听几个黑客说，喝半杯啤酒就完全写不了代码了。所以编程可能需要特殊的专注力：优秀的黑客或许能在脑海中加载大量上下文，看到一行代码时，不只是这行，还有周围的整个程序。约翰・麦克菲曾写道，比尔・布拉德利篮球打得好，部分原因是他非凡的周边视觉：“完美” 视力的垂直周边视野约 47 度，而他有 70 度，看地板时能看到篮筐。或许优秀的黑客也有类似的天赋（我作弊的方式是用非常简洁的语言，缩小 “球场”）。</p>
<p>This could explain the disconnect over cubicles. Maybe the people in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter, have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having one’s brain in a blender. (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism are true, knows all too well.)<br>这或许能解释为什么在隔间问题上存在分歧：负责办公设施的人可能没什么专注力可被破坏，所以完全不知道在隔间工作对黑客来说就像脑子被放进了搅拌机（而如果关于比尔有自闭症的传言是真的，他就太懂这种感受了）。</p>
<p>One difference I’ve noticed between great hackers and smart people in general is that hackers are more politically incorrect. To the extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it’s when they know one another well enough to express opinions that would get them stoned to death by the general public. And I can see why political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming. Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good programmers, very fluid. In such situations it’s helpful to have a habit of questioning assumptions.<br>我注意到优秀黑客和一般聪明人之间的一个区别：黑客更 “政治不正确”。如果说优秀黑客之间有什么 “秘密暗号”，那就是彼此足够熟悉后，能说出那些会被大众 “乱石砸死” 的观点。我能理解为什么 “政治不正确” 在编程中是有用的特质：程序非常复杂，而且在优秀程序员手中极具流动性，这种情况下，有质疑假设的习惯是有帮助的。</p>
<p>Can you cultivate these qualities? I don’t know. But you can at least not repress them. So here is my best shot at a recipe. If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise), and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job. All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.<br>这些特质能培养吗？我不知道。但至少可以不压抑它们。所以我斗胆给出一个 “配方”：如果有可能让自己成为优秀的黑客，方法或许是和自己达成协议 —— 绝不做无聊的项目（除非家人要挨饿），作为回报，绝不敷衍了事。我认识的所有优秀黑客似乎都达成了这个协议，或许他们别无选择。</p>
