<p>May 2004</p>
<p>When people care enough about something to do it well, those who do it best tend to be far better than everyone else. There’s a huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like Borgognone. You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels. A top-ranked professional chess player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once.</p>
<p>当人们足够在乎某件事并力求做好时，做得最好的人往往会远超其他人。莱昂纳多和博尔戈尼奥内这类二流同代人之间存在巨大差距；雷蒙德・钱德勒和普通侦探小说作家之间也有同样的差距；顶级职业国际象棋选手和普通俱乐部选手对弈一万局，可能一局都不会输。</p>
<p>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill differently. No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.</p>
<p>和下棋、绘画、写小说一样，赚钱是一种非常专业的技能。但出于某种原因，我们对这种技能的态度不同。当少数人在象棋或小说创作上远超他人时，没人会抱怨；但当少数人比其他人赚更多钱时，就会有社论指责这是错误的。</p>
<p>Why? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill. What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making money?</p>
<p>为什么会这样？这种差异模式似乎和其他任何技能都没什么不同。为什么当这种技能是赚钱时，人们的反应会如此强烈？</p>
<p>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different: the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society. As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false. Could it be that, in a modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?</p>
<p>我认为我们把赚钱视为不同的事情，有三个原因：我们小时候学到的关于财富的误导性模型；直到最近，大多数财富积累的不光彩方式；以及担心收入差距过大对社会有害。在我看来，第一个原因是错误的，第二个已经过时，第三个则与事实不符。难道在现代民主社会中，收入差异实际上是健康的标志？</p>
<h3 id="The-Daddy-Model-of-Wealth"><a href="#The-Daddy-Model-of-Wealth" class="headerlink" title="The Daddy Model of Wealth"></a><strong>The Daddy Model of Wealth</strong></h3><p><strong>财富的爸爸模型</strong></p>
<p>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric sockets. I didn’t realize there were power plants out there generating it. Likewise, it doesn’t occur to most kids that wealth is something that has to be generated. It seems to be something that flows from parents.</p>
<p>我五岁时以为电是插座产生的，没意识到外面有发电厂在发电。同样，大多数孩子不会想到财富是需要创造的，他们觉得财富似乎是从父母那里来的。</p>
<p>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children tend to misunderstand wealth. They confuse it with money. They think that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think of it as something that’s distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created (and might be created unequally).</p>
<p>由于孩子们接触财富的环境，他们往往会误解财富。他们把财富和金钱混为一谈，认为财富的总量是固定的，还认为财富是由权威人士分配的（因此应该平均分配），而不是需要创造出来的（且创造出来的数量可能不均等）。</p>
<p>In fact, wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of trading one form of wealth for another. Wealth is the underlying stuff—the goods and services we buy. When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don’t have to look at people’s bank accounts to tell which kind you’re in. You can see wealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health of the people.</p>
<p>事实上，财富不是金钱。金钱只是一种将一种形式的财富换成另一种形式的便捷方式。财富是根本 —— 是我们购买的商品和服务。当你去一个富裕或贫穷的国家旅行时，不必看人们的银行账户就能分辨出是哪种国家。你能看到财富 —— 在建筑和街道上，在人们的衣着和健康状况中。</p>
<p>Where does wealth come from? People make it. This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands. Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. It was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie. If you wanted more wealth, you could make it.</p>
<p>财富从何而来？是人们创造出来的。以前大多数人住在农场，亲手制作许多自己需要的东西时，这一点更容易理解。那时，你能从房子、牲畜和谷仓中看到每个家庭创造的财富。而且很明显，世界上的财富不是像馅饼一样固定不变、必须分割的数量。如果你想要更多财富，你可以去创造。</p>
<p>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks). Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want. [1]</p>
<p>如今这一点依然正确，尽管我们中很少有人直接为自己创造财富（除了一些残留的家务）。大多数时候，我们为别人创造财富，以此换取金钱，然后用金钱去换取我们想要的财富形式。[1]</p>
<p>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has to be given to them. And when wealth is something you’re given, then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally. [2] As in most families it is. The kids see to that. “Unfair,” they cry, when one sibling gets more than another.</p>
<p>因为孩子们无法创造财富，他们所拥有的一切都必须是别人给予的。当财富是被给予的东西时，当然看起来应该平均分配。[2] 大多数家庭也是这样做的。孩子们会监督这一点：当一个兄弟姐妹得到的比另一个多时，他们会大喊 “不公平”。</p>
<p>In the real world, you can’t keep living off your parents. If you want something, you either have to make it, or do something of equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have to create, not something that’s distributed by Daddy. And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person, it’s not made equally.</p>
<p>在现实世界中，你不能一直靠父母生活。如果你想要某样东西，要么自己制作，要么为别人做同等价值的事情，以便让他们给你足够的钱去买。在现实世界中，财富（除了小偷和投机者等少数人）是需要创造的，而不是由 “爸爸” 分配的。而且由于创造财富的能力和意愿因人而异，财富的创造也不会均等。</p>
<p>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors. The B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want that extra oomph that the big stars have.</p>
<p>你通过做人们想要的事或制作人们想要的东西获得报酬，那些赚更多钱的人往往只是更擅长做人们想要的事。顶级演员比二线演员赚得多得多。二线演员可能也差不多有魅力，但当人们去电影院看排片表时，他们想要的是大明星所具有的那种额外的吸引力。</p>
<p>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course. You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income. The root cause of variation in income, as Occam’s Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill.</p>
<p>当然，做人们想要的事并不是赚钱的唯一方式。你也可以抢劫银行、索取贿赂或建立垄断。这些手段导致了一些财富差异，甚至一些最大的个人财富也是如此，但它们并不是收入差异的根本原因。正如奥卡姆剃刀原理所暗示的，收入差异的根本原因与其他人类技能差异的根本原因是一样的。</p>
<p>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about 100 times as much as the average person. [3] Basketball players make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much. Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror. But I have no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another. In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills. [4] And that’s without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology.</p>
<p>在美国，大型上市公司的首席执行官收入大约是普通人的 100 倍。[3] 篮球运动员大约是 128 倍，棒球运动员是 72 倍。社论引用这类数据时带着恐惧，但我完全能想象一个人的生产力可能是另一个人的 100 倍。在古罗马，奴隶的价格因技能不同而相差 50 倍。[4] 这还没考虑到动力，以及现代技术带来的生产力额外优势。</p>
<p>Editorials about athletes’ or CEOs’ salaries remind me of early Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check. [5] How much someone’s work is worth is not a policy question. It’s something the market already determines.</p>
<p>关于运动员或首席执行官薪水的社论让我想起早期的基督教作家，他们从基本原理上争论地球是否是圆的，而他们本可以出去看看就能验证。[5] 一个人的工作值多少钱不是政策问题，市场已经做出了决定。</p>
<p>“Are they really worth 100 of us?” editorialists ask. Depends on what you mean by worth. If you mean worth in the sense of what people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.</p>
<p>“他们真的抵得上我们 100 个人吗？” 社论作者问道。这取决于 “ worth（价值）” 的含义。如果指的是人们愿意为他们的技能支付多少钱，答案显然是肯定的。</p>
<p>A few CEOs’ incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing. But are there not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate? Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline. And not merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs; he had to decide what Apple’s next products should be. Few others could have done it. And regardless of the case with CEOs, it’s hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional basketball players don’t reflect supply and demand.</p>
<p>少数首席执行官的收入反映了某种不当行为。但难道没有其他人的收入真的反映了他们创造的财富吗？史蒂夫・乔布斯拯救了一家濒临破产的公司。而且他不只是像扭亏为盈专家那样通过削减成本，他还必须决定苹果的下一款产品是什么。很少有人能做到这一点。而且不管首席执行官的情况如何，很难想象有人会认为职业篮球运动员的薪水不反映供求关系。</p>
<p>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really generate so much more wealth than another. The key to this mystery is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us? Would a basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people? What would Apple’s next product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? [6] These things don’t scale linearly. Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. But it makes all the difference that it’s concentrated in one individual.</p>
<p>原则上，一个人真的能比另一个人创造多得多的财富，这似乎不太可能。解开这个谜团的关键是重新审视那个问题：他们真的抵得上我们 100 个人吗？一支篮球队会用他们的一名球员去换 100 个随机挑选的人吗？如果用 100 个随机挑选的人组成的委员会取代史蒂夫・乔布斯，苹果的下一款产品会是什么样子？[6] 这些事情不是线性递增的。也许首席执行官或职业运动员的技能和决心只是普通人的十倍（不管这意味着什么），但关键在于这些能力集中在一个人身上，这就完全不同了。</p>
<p>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying? In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want. People like baseball more than poetry, so baseball players make more than poets. To say that a certain kind of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things.</p>
<p>当我们说一种工作报酬过高而另一种过低时，我们真正在说什么？在自由市场中，价格由购买者的需求决定。人们更喜欢棒球而不是诗歌，所以棒球运动员比诗人赚得多。因此，说某种工作报酬过低，就等同于说人们想要的东西是错误的。</p>
<p>Well, of course people want the wrong things. It seems odd to be surprised by that. And it seems even odder to say that it’s unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid. [7] Then you’re saying that it’s unjust that people want the wrong things. It’s lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust? That seems like saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.</p>
<p>当然，人们会想要错误的东西。对此感到惊讶似乎很奇怪，而说某些工作报酬过低是不公正的，就更奇怪了。[7] 这相当于说人们想要错误的东西是不公正的。人们喜欢真人秀和玉米热狗胜过莎士比亚和蒸蔬菜，这很令人遗憾，但这是不公正吗？这就像说蓝色是沉重的，或者向上是圆形的一样荒谬。</p>
<p>The appearance of the word “unjust” here is the unmistakable spectral signature of the Daddy Model. Why else would this idea occur in this odd context? Whereas if the speaker were still operating on the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a common source and had to be shared out, rather than something generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what you’d get on noticing that some people made much more than others.</p>
<p>“不公正” 这个词的出现，是 “爸爸模型” 的明显特征。否则，这个想法怎么会出现在这种奇怪的语境中呢？如果说话者仍然按照 “爸爸模型” 思考，把财富看作是从一个共同来源流出、必须分配的东西，而不是通过做别人想要的事情创造出来的东西，那么当注意到有些人比其他人赚得多时，就会产生这种想法。</p>
<p>When we talk about “unequal distribution of income,” we should also ask, where does that income come from? [8] Who made the wealth it represents? Because to the extent that income varies simply according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may be unequal, but it’s hardly unjust.</p>
<p>当我们谈论 “收入分配不均” 时，我们还应该问，这些收入来自哪里？[8] 是谁创造了它所代表的财富？因为如果收入差异仅仅是由人们创造的财富多少决定的，那么这种分配可能不均等，但很难说是不公正的。</p>
<h3 id="Stealing-It"><a href="#Stealing-It" class="headerlink" title="Stealing It"></a><strong>Stealing It</strong></h3><p><strong>窃取财富</strong></p>
<p>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding; in agricultural societies by appropriating others’ estates in times of war, and taxing them in times of peace.</p>
<p>我们倾向于认为巨大的财富差距令人担忧的第二个原因是，在人类历史的大部分时间里，积累财富的通常方式是窃取：在游牧社会通过抢牛；在农业社会通过战争时期侵占他人财产，和平时期对其征税。</p>
<p>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates confiscated from the losers. In England in the 1060s, when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to his followers, the conflict was military. By the 1530s, when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers, it was mostly political. [9] But the principle was the same. Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>在冲突中，获胜方会获得从失败者那里没收的财产。11 世纪 60 年代的英格兰，征服者威廉将战败的盎格鲁 - 撒克逊贵族的财产分给追随者，当时的冲突是军事性质的。到 16 世纪 30 年代，亨利八世将修道院的财产分给追随者时，这主要是政治行为。[9] 但原则是一样的。事实上，同样的原则现在在津巴布韦也在起作用。</p>
<p>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials used taxation instead of confiscation. But here too we see the same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.</p>
<p>在更有组织的社会，比如中国，统治者及其官员用征税代替没收。但这里我们也看到同样的原则：致富的方式不是创造财富，而是为一个有足够权力侵占财富的统治者服务。</p>
<p>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.</p>
<p>随着中产阶级在欧洲的兴起，这种情况开始改变。现在我们认为中产阶级是既不富也不穷的人，但最初他们是一个独特的群体。在封建社会，只有两个阶级：武士贵族和为他们耕种土地的农奴。中产阶级是一个新的第三群体，他们住在城镇，靠制造业和贸易为生。</p>
<p>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords. [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.</p>
<p>从 10 世纪和 11 世纪开始，小贵族和前农奴在城镇联合起来，这些城镇逐渐强大到可以无视当地封建领主。[10] 和农奴一样，中产阶级主要靠创造财富谋生（在热那亚和比萨等港口城市，他们也从事海盗活动）。但与农奴不同的是，他们有动力创造大量财富。农奴创造的任何财富都属于他的主人，创造出超过能隐藏的数量没有多大意义。而城镇居民的独立性使他们能够保留自己创造的所有财富。</p>
<p>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly. Nearly everything we have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)</p>
<p>一旦通过创造财富可以致富，整个社会就开始迅速变得富裕起来。我们拥有的几乎所有东西都是中产阶级创造的。事实上，在工业社会中，另外两个阶级已经实际上消失了，他们的名称被赋予了中产阶级的两端（从这个词的原始意义来说，比尔・盖茨是中产阶级）。</p>
<p>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called “corruption”) when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.</p>
<p>但直到工业革命，创造财富才明确取代腐败成为致富的最佳方式。至少在英国，当出现其他更快的致富方式时，腐败才变得不合时宜（实际上才开始被称为 “腐败”）。</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth. The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call corruption than from commerce. [11] By the nineteenth century that had changed. There continued to be bribes, as there still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who were driven more by vanity than greed. Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it. The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier but an industrialist.</p>
<p>17 世纪的英格兰很像今天的第三世界，政府职位是公认的致富途径。当时的巨额财富更多来自我们现在所说的腐败，而不是商业。[11] 到了 19 世纪，情况发生了变化。贿赂仍然存在，就像现在各地一样，但那时的政治已经由那些更多受虚荣心而非贪婪驱使的人掌控。技术使得创造财富的速度超过了窃取财富的速度。19 世纪典型的富人不是朝臣，而是实业家。</p>
<p>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game. Jobs and Wozniak didn’t have to make us poor to make themselves rich. Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives materially richer. They had to, or we wouldn’t have paid for them.</p>
<p>随着中产阶级的兴起，财富不再是零和游戏。乔布斯和沃兹尼亚克不必让我们变穷就能让自己变富。恰恰相反：他们创造的东西让我们的物质生活更加丰富。他们必须这样做，否则我们不会为他们的产品付钱。</p>
<p>But since for most of the world’s history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people. Idealistic undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child’s model of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. It is a case of the mistaken meeting the outdated.</p>
<p>但由于在世界历史的大部分时间里，致富的主要途径是窃取，我们往往对富人持怀疑态度。理想主义的大学生发现，他们潜意识中保留的儿童式财富模型，被过去的著名作家所证实。这是错误与过时的结合。</p>
<p>“Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,” Balzac wrote. Except he didn’t. What he actually said was that a great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten. If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France, where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced. He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it. After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist. [12]</p>
<p>“每一笔巨大的财富背后，都有一桩罪行。” 巴尔扎克写道。但他其实没说过这句话。他实际上说的是，一笔没有明显原因的巨大财富，可能源于一桩实施得极为巧妙以至于被遗忘的罪行。如果我们谈论的是 1000 年的欧洲，或者今天的大多数第三世界国家，这种常见的误引是准确的。但巴尔扎克生活在 19 世纪的法国，那时工业革命已经很发达。他知道不通过窃取也能积累财富。毕竟，他自己作为一名畅销小说家就做到了。[12]</p>
<p>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have reached this stage. In most, corruption still has the upper hand. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it. And so when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country, there is a tendency to worry that it’s sliding back toward becoming another Venezuela. I think the opposite is happening. I think you’re seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.</p>
<p>只有少数国家（并非巧合，都是最富裕的国家）达到了这个阶段。在大多数国家，腐败仍然占上风，致富最快的方式是窃取。因此，当我们看到一个富裕国家的收入差距在扩大时，往往会担心它会退化成另一个委内瑞拉。但我认为情况恰恰相反，我认为你看到的是一个比委内瑞拉领先一大步的国家。</p>
<h3 id="The-Lever-of-Technology"><a href="#The-Lever-of-Technology" class="headerlink" title="The Lever of Technology"></a><strong>The Lever of Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>技术的杠杆</strong></p>
<p>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? It will certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive. That’s the whole point of technology. With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses. But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.</p>
<p>技术会扩大贫富差距吗？它肯定会扩大有生产力和无生产力的人之间的差距。这就是技术的核心意义。有了拖拉机，一个精力充沛的农民一天能耕种的土地是用马队的六倍，但前提是他掌握了新的耕作方式。</p>
<p>I’ve seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time. In high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. This was the only kind of work available at the time. Now high school kids could write software or design web sites. But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.</p>
<p>在我自己的时代，我亲眼目睹了技术杠杆的显著增长。高中时，我靠割草坪和在巴斯金 - 罗宾斯冰淇淋店舀冰淇淋赚钱，那是当时唯一能找到的工作。现在的高中生可以编写软件或设计网站，但只有一部分人会这样做，其他人仍然会去舀冰淇淋。</p>
<p>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own. Within months I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer. A few years before, I couldn’t have done this. A few years before, there was no such thing as a freelance programmer. But Apple created wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers immediately set to work using it to create more.</p>
<p>我清楚地记得，1985 年，技术的进步让我能够买到自己的电脑。几个月内，我就用它作为自由程序员赚钱了。几年前，我还做不到这一点，那时根本没有自由程序员这种职业。但苹果公司以强大而廉价的电脑形式创造了财富，程序员们立即开始利用它创造更多财富。</p>
<p>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases our productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear. So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on. Will that increase the gap between rich and the poor? Depends which gap you mean.</p>
<p>正如这个例子所表明的，技术提高我们生产力的速度可能是指数级的，而不是线性的。因此，我们应该预料到，随着时间的推移，个人生产力的差异会越来越大。这会扩大贫富差距吗？这取决于你指的是哪种差距。</p>
<p>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants. Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average person.</p>
<p>技术应该会扩大收入差距，但似乎会缩小其他差距。一百年前，富人的生活与普通人截然不同。他们住在满是仆人的房子里，穿着精致却不舒服的衣服，乘坐由马队牵引的马车出行，而马本身也需要住所和仆人照料。现在，多亏了技术，富人的生活更像普通人了。</p>
<p>Cars are a good example of why. It’s possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there is not much point. Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. So a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise that you can.</p>
<p>汽车就是一个很好的例子。你可以买到价值数十万美元的昂贵手工汽车，但没什么意义。公司生产大量普通汽车比生产少量昂贵汽车更赚钱，所以生产量产车的公司有能力在设计上投入更多。如果你买一辆定制汽车，总会有东西出故障。现在买定制车的唯一意义就是炫耀你买得起。</p>
<p>Or consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a watch you could get better performance. When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. Not any more. Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. [13] Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you’re determined to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical watches have to be wound.</p>
<p>再看看手表。五十年前，花很多钱买一块手表能获得更好的性能。当时手表是机械机芯，昂贵的手表走时更准。现在不是这样了。自从石英机芯发明以来，一块普通的天美时手表比价值数十万美元的百达翡丽更准确。[13] 事实上，就像昂贵的汽车一样，如果你执意要花很多钱买一块手表，你就得忍受一些不便：机械表不仅走时更不准，还得上发条。</p>
<p>The only thing technology can’t cheapen is brand. Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. But what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich. And if you weren’t rich, you took the omnibus or walked. Now even the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we’re so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones. [14]</p>
<p>技术唯一无法降低成本的是品牌。这正是我们越来越多地听到品牌的原因。随着富人和穷人之间的实质性差异消失，品牌成了残留的东西。但你的东西上有什么标签，比起拥有它和没有它来说，是件小事。1900 年，如果你有一辆马车，没人会问是哪一年的或什么牌子的，有马车就说明你富有。如果你不富有，就只能坐公共马车或步行。现在，即使是最贫穷的美国人也能开车，我们之所以能认出那些特别昂贵的车，只是因为广告对我们的影响太深了。[14]</p>
<p>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions will be, if not better, at least more convenient. [15] And there is nothing the rich like more than convenience. The rich people I know drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind of furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends. Their houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but within them life is similar. The houses are made using the same construction techniques and contain much the same objects. It’s inconvenient to do something expensive and custom.</p>
<p>同样的模式在一个又一个行业上演。如果某样东西有足够的需求，技术会让它变得足够便宜，从而可以大量销售，而量产版本即使不是更好，至少也更方便。[15] 富人最喜欢的莫过于方便。我认识的富人，和我的其他朋友开一样的车、穿一样的衣服、用一样的家具、吃一样的食物。他们的房子可能在不同的社区，或者在同一个社区但大小不同，但房子里的生活是相似的。房子用同样的建筑技术建造，里面的东西也大致相同。做昂贵的定制化事情是很不方便的。</p>
<p>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too. Bertie Wooster seems long gone. Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway. It’s not just social pressure that makes them; idleness is lonely and demoralizing.</p>
<p>富人的时间安排也越来越像普通人了。伯蒂・伍斯特式的闲人似乎早已消失。现在，大多数足够富有可以不工作的人仍然在工作。这不仅仅是社会压力使然，无所事事是孤独且令人消沉的。</p>
<p>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years ago. The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now like descriptions of some strange tribal society. “With respect to the continuance of friendships…” hints Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management (1880), “it may be found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life.” A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends who didn’t. You’d seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today. You’d also have a very boring life. People still tend to segregate themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than wealth. [16]</p>
<p>我们也不再有一百年前的社会阶层差异了。那个时期的小说和礼仪手册现在读起来就像对某种奇怪部落社会的描述。《比顿夫人的家庭管理全书》（1880 年）中暗示：“关于友谊的延续…… 在某些情况下，女主人在承担起家庭责任后，可能有必要放弃她早年建立的许多友谊。” 嫁给富人的女人被期望疏远那些不富裕的朋友。如今，如果你那样做，会显得像个野蛮人，而且你的生活也会非常无聊。人们仍然倾向于在一定程度上自我隔离，但更多是基于教育程度而非财富。[16]</p>
<p>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it. If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he’d think communism had won. Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics. Everything would seem exactly as he’d predicted, until he looked at their bank accounts. Oops.</p>
<p>在物质和社会层面，技术似乎在缩小而不是扩大贫富差距。如果列宁走进雅虎、英特尔或思科这样的公司办公室，他会认为共产主义已经胜利了。每个人都穿着同样的衣服，拥有同样的办公室（或者说隔间）和同样的家具，彼此称呼名字而不是尊称。一切似乎都和他预测的完全一样，直到他看到他们的银行账户。哎呀。</p>
<p>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap? It doesn’t seem to be so far. As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps.</p>
<p>如果技术扩大了收入差距，这是个问题吗？到目前为止似乎不是。因为当它扩大收入差距时，似乎缩小了大多数其他差距。</p>
<h3 id="Alternative-to-an-Axiom"><a href="#Alternative-to-an-Axiom" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to an Axiom"></a><strong>Alternative to an Axiom</strong></h3><p><strong>公理的替代观点</strong></p>
<p>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor. As if it were an axiom that this would be bad. It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad, but I don’t see how we can say it’s axiomatic.</p>
<p>人们经常听到一项政策因会扩大贫富收入差距而受到批评，仿佛这必然是坏事一样。收入差异扩大可能确实是坏事，但我不明白为什么这会被视为公理。</p>
<p>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies. In a society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a sign of an underlying problem. But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income. A 747 pilot doesn’t make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable.</p>
<p>事实上，在工业民主国家，这甚至可能是错误的。在一个由农奴和军阀组成的社会里，收入差异当然是潜在问题的标志。但农奴制并不是收入差异的唯一原因。一架 747 客机的飞行员收入是收银员的 40 倍，不是因为他是一个以某种方式控制着收银员的军阀，而仅仅是因为他的技能更有价值。</p>
<p>I’d like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If we don’t see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren’t doing it, or (c) that they aren’t getting paid for it.</p>
<p>我想提出一个替代观点：在现代社会，收入差异的扩大是健康的标志。技术似乎以快于线性的速度扩大生产力差异。如果我们没有看到相应的收入差异，可能有三个原因：（a）技术创新已经停止；（b）那些能创造最多财富的人没有去创造；（c）他们创造了财富却没有得到报酬。</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad. If you disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us. (I’ll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)</p>
<p>我认为可以肯定地说，（a）和（b）都是坏事。如果你不同意，试着用 800 年法兰克贵族平均能拥有的资源生活一年，然后回来告诉我们（我会宽宏大量，不会让你回到石器时代）。</p>
<p>The only option, if you’re going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it. That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them, after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.</p>
<p>如果你想拥有一个日益繁荣的社会，同时又不扩大收入差异，唯一的选择似乎是（c）：人们创造大量财富却得不到报酬。例如，乔布斯和沃兹尼亚克会心甘情愿地每天工作 20 小时来生产苹果电脑，而社会只允许他们在税后保留足够的收入，仅相当于他们在大公司朝九晚五工作的收入。</p>
<p>Will people create wealth if they can’t get paid for it? Only if it’s fun. People will write operating systems for free. But they won’t install them, or take support calls, or train customers to use them. And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.</p>
<p>如果得不到报酬，人们会创造财富吗？只有当这件事有趣的时候才会。人们会免费编写操作系统，但他们不会去安装、接听支持电话或培训客户使用。即使是最高科技的公司，至少 90% 的工作都是这种不那么有趣的工作。</p>
<p>All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society that confiscates private fortunes. We can confirm this empirically. Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a nearby fan. You turn the fan off, and the noise stops. You turn the fan back on, and the noise starts again. Off, quiet. On, noise. In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise is caused by the fan.</p>
<p>在一个没收私人财富的社会里，所有那些不有趣的财富创造都会急剧减少。我们可以通过经验来证实这一点。假设你听到一个奇怪的声音，你认为可能是附近的风扇发出的。你关掉风扇，声音停止了；你再打开风扇，声音又开始了；关掉，安静；打开，有声音。在没有其他信息的情况下，似乎可以确定声音是风扇引起的。</p>
<p>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off. Northern Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it). Northern Italy in 1100, on. Central France in 1100, off (still feudal). England in 1800, on. England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income). United States in 1974, on. We’ve even had a twin study: West Germany, on; East Germany, off. In every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.</p>
<p>在历史上的不同时间和地点，通过创造财富积累财富的可能性时有时无。800 年的意大利北部，不可能（军阀会窃取）；1100 年的意大利北部，可能；1100 年的法国中部，不可能（仍处于封建制）；1800 年的英国，可能；1974 年的英国，不可能（投资收入税率 98%）；1974 年的美国，可能。我们甚至有一个 “双胞胎研究”：西德，可能；东德，不可能。在所有这些案例中，财富创造的出现和消失，就像你打开或关闭保留财富的可能性时风扇发出的声音一样。</p>
<p>There is some momentum involved. It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England). But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.</p>
<p>这其中涉及到一些惯性。把人变成东德人那样可能至少需要一代人的时间（对英国来说幸运的是）。但如果我们研究的仅仅是风扇，没有财富这个有争议的话题带来的额外包袱，没人会怀疑是风扇发出了声音。</p>
<p>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same. Society as a whole ends up poorer.</p>
<p>如果你抑制收入差异，无论是像封建统治者那样窃取私人财富，还是像一些现代政府那样通过税收剥夺，结果似乎总是一样的：整个社会最终会变得更贫穷。</p>
<p>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I’d take the first option. If I had children, it would arguably be immoral not to. It’s absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty. If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one or the other in your society, take relative poverty.</p>
<p>如果我可以选择住在这样一个社会：我在物质上比现在好得多，但属于最贫穷的人；或者住在另一个社会：我是最富有的人，但物质上比现在差得多，我会选择第一个选项。如果我有孩子，不这样选择可能是不道德的。你想要避免的是绝对贫困，而不是相对贫困。如果正如迄今为止的证据所暗示的那样，你的社会必须有其中一种贫困，那就选择相对贫困吧。</p>
<p>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich. I’m not talking about the trickle-down effect here. I’m not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he’ll hire you as a waiter at his next party. I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your horse.</p>
<p>社会需要富人，与其说是因为他们花钱创造了就业机会，不如说是因为他们为了致富所必须做的事情。我这里说的不是涓滴效应。我不是说如果你让亨利・福特致富，他会在下次派对上雇你当服务员。我是说他会为你制造一台拖拉机来取代你的马。</p>
<h3 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a><strong>Notes</strong></h3><p>[1] Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have the least experience creating it. (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)</p>
<p>[1] 这个话题争议性很大，部分原因在于，在财富话题上最直言不讳的一些人 —— 大学生、继承人、教授、政客和记者 —— 恰恰是创造财富经验最少的人。（任何在酒吧里听过人们谈论体育的人，都会对这种现象感到熟悉。）</p>
<p>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped to think about where that money comes from. Heirs will be on the parental dole for life. Professors and politicians live within socialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation of wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they work. And journalists as part of their professional code segregate themselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they work for (the ad sales department). Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone else created earlier. They live in a world in which income is doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given by other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem to them unfair that things don’t work the same in the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>学生大多还在靠父母资助，没有想过那些钱是从哪里来的。继承人则一辈子都靠父母留下的钱生活。教授和政客生活在经济中的社会主义漩涡里，与财富创造隔了一层，无论工作多努力，都拿固定报酬。而记者作为职业规范的一部分，与他们所在机构负责创收的部门（广告销售部）隔离开来。这些人中的许多人从未正视过一个事实：他们收到的钱代表着财富 —— 除了记者的情况之外，这些财富都是别人早先创造出来的。他们生活在这样一个世界里：收入由一个中央权威根据某种抽象的公平概念分配（对继承人来说则是随机分配），而不是别人为了换取自己想要的东西而给予的。因此，在他们看来，经济的其他领域不是这样运作的，这似乎不公平。</p>
<p>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for society. But the money they’re paid isn’t a quid pro quo. It’s more in the nature of an investment.)</p>

<p>[2] When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it sounds like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian child-heroes of Edith Nesbit’s The Wouldbegoods.</p>

<p>[3] According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise of stock options, of S&amp;P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million. According to Sports Illustrated, the average NBA player’s salary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average major league baseball player’s salary at the start of the 2003 season was $2.56 million. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.</p>

<p>[4] In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, Sat. ii.7.43). A servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8) says that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000. A doctor, P. Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau, Inscriptiones 7812). Seneca (Ep. xxvii.7) reports that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves learned in the Greek classics. Pliny (Hist. Nat. vii.39) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was 700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis, but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom.</p>
<p>[4] 在罗马帝国早期，一个普通成年奴隶的价格似乎约为 2,000 塞斯特斯（如贺拉斯《讽刺诗》ii.7.43）。一个女仆价值 600 塞斯特斯（马提亚尔《讽刺诗》vi.66），而科卢梅拉（《论农业》iii.3.8）说一个熟练的葡萄园丁值 8,000 塞斯特斯。一位名叫 P・德西姆斯・埃罗斯・梅鲁拉的医生为换取自由支付了 50,000 塞斯特斯（德绍《拉丁铭文集成》7812）。塞内加（《书信集》xxvii.7）记载，一个叫卡尔维西乌斯・萨比努斯的人为每个精通希腊古典文献的奴隶支付 100,000 塞斯特斯。普林尼（《自然史》vii.39）说，在他那个时代，为奴隶支付的最高价格是 700,000 塞斯特斯，买的是语言学家（大概也是教师）达芙妮，但后来演员为换取自己自由所支付的价格超过了这个数。</p>
<p>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices. An ordinary laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae. Xenophon (Mem. ii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the manager of a silver mine).</p>
<p>古典时期的雅典也存在类似的价格差异。一个普通劳工约值 125 到 150 德拉克马。色诺芬（《回忆录》ii.5）提到奴隶价格从 50 到 6,000 德拉克马不等（6,000 德拉克马是银矿经理的价格）。</p>

<p>[7] One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is the valuation of hard work. In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself deserving. In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. If I paint someone’s house, the owner shouldn’t pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.</p>
<p>[7] “爸爸模型” 与现实之间最大的分歧之一在于对努力工作的评价。在 “爸爸模型” 中，努力工作本身就值得回报。而在现实中，财富的衡量标准是一个人交付了什么，而不是付出了多少努力。如果我给别人粉刷房子，房主不应该因为我用牙刷刷就多付钱。</p>
<p>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn’t get paid much. To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit. If he’s bad at it he’ll work very hard and not end up with much food. Is this unfair? Who is being unfair to him?</p>
<p>对于那些仍然下意识地按照 “爸爸模型” 思考的人来说，当一个人努力工作却没得到多少报酬时，会觉得这是不公平的。为了把事情说清楚，我们可以假设其他所有人都不存在，只让这个工人处在一个荒岛上，靠打猎和采集果实为生。如果他不擅长这些，他会非常努力地工作，却最终得不到多少食物。这是不公平吗？谁对他不公平了？</p>
<p>[8] Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be the dual meaning of “distribution.” When economists talk about “distribution of income,” they mean statistical distribution. But when you use the phrase frequently, you can’t help associating it with the other sense of the word (as in e.g. “distribution of alms”), and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows from some central tap. The word “regressive” as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything regressive be good?</p>
<p>[8] “爸爸模型” 之所以根深蒂固，部分原因可能在于 “distribution（分配）” 一词的双重含义。当经济学家谈论 “收入分配（distribution of income）” 时，他们指的是统计分布。但当你频繁使用这个短语时，会不由自主地将其与该词的另一种含义联系起来（如 “施舍的分配（distribution of alms）”），从而下意识地把财富看作是从某个中央水龙头流出的东西。“累退的（regressive）” 一词用于描述税率时也有类似的效果，至少对我来说是这样：一个 “后退的” 东西怎么可能是好的呢？</p>
<p>[9] “From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards. In 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom of Rutland. In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome, his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason trials that punctuated Henry’s erratic matrimonial progress made him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property.”</p>
<p>[9] “从亨利八世统治初期开始，托马斯・鲁斯勋爵就是这位年轻国王的殷勤朝臣，并很快获得了回报。1525 年，他被授予嘉德骑士爵位，并获封拉特兰伯爵。在 30 年代，他支持与罗马教廷决裂，积极镇压‘求恩巡礼’运动，在亨利八世变幻莫测的婚姻进程中所引发的一系列引人注目的叛国罪审判中，他都准备好投票支持死刑判决，这使他成为获得修道院财产赏赐的当然人选。”</p>

<p>[11] William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most powerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to amass fortunes among the largest of their times. Robert in particular took bribery to the point of treason. “As Secretary of State and the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make peace.” (Stone, op. cit., p. 17.)</p>
<p>[11] 威廉・塞西尔和他的儿子罗伯特先后担任英国最有权势的王室大臣，两人都利用职位积累了当时数一数二的财富。尤其是罗伯特，受贿到了叛国的地步。“作为国务卿和詹姆斯国王外交政策的主要顾问，[他] 是各方争相讨好的对象，荷兰人向他巨额行贿，希望他阻止英国与西班牙讲和；西班牙人也向他巨额行贿，希望促成和谈。”（斯通，同前引，第 17 页。）</p>

<p>[13] A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. The most accurate mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5 to +2 seconds. Its retail price is about $220,000.</p>

<p>[14] If asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved 1989 Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine ($5,000) or a 2004 Mercedes S600 sedan ($122,000), the average Edwardian might well guess wrong.</p>
<p>[14] 如果让一个爱德华时代的普通人来选哪样更贵：一辆保存完好的 1989 年产林肯城市十座豪华轿车（5,000 美元），还是一辆 2004 年产梅赛德斯 - 奔驰 S600 轿车（122,000 美元），他很可能会猜错。</p>
<p>[15] To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy. But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally accurate, and that don’t include the prices of new inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.</p>
<p>[15] 要对收入趋势说些有意义的话，就必须谈论实际收入，即按购买力衡量的收入。但通常计算实际收入的方法忽略了随着时间推移财富的大部分增长，因为这种方法依赖于消费者价格指数，而该指数是通过将一系列仅在局部准确的数字拼接而成的，并且在新发明变得足够普遍、价格稳定之前，不会将其价格纳入其中。</p>
<p>So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.</p>
<p>因此，尽管我们可能认为生活在一个有抗生素、航空旅行或电网的世界里比没有这些东西要好得多，但按通常方法计算的实际收入统计数据会向我们证明，拥有这些东西只会让我们稍微富裕一点。</p>
<p>Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade goods to make your fortune? For example, if you were going back to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least $150 million in 1970. The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly, because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you needed in present-day trash. In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.</p>
<p>另一种方法是问：如果你乘坐时光机回到 x 年，需要花多少钱购买贸易商品才能发家致富？例如，如果你回到 1970 年，肯定用不了 500 美元，因为如今 500 美元能买到的处理能力，在 1970 年至少值 1.5 亿美元。这个函数会很快趋近于极限，因为对于一百多年前的时代，你从当今的垃圾中就能找到所有需要的东西。在 1800 年，一个带螺旋盖的空塑料饮料瓶会被视为工艺的奇迹。</p>
<p>[16] Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have better opportunities for education. That’s a valid point. It is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids’ way into top colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the college admissions process.</p>
<p>[16] 有些人会说这其实是一回事，因为富人有更好的教育机会。这一点有道理。在某种程度上，通过送孩子去私立学校，实际上是钻了大学招生流程的空子，从而为孩子买到进入顶尖大学的机会，这仍然是可能的。</p>
<p>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian schools. At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such schools. (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly lower, about 28%.) Obviously this is a huge loophole. It does at least seem to be closing, not widening.</p>
<p>根据美国国家教育统计中心 2002 年的一份报告，约 1.7% 的美国孩子就读于非宗教类私立学校。在普林斯顿大学 2007 届学生中，36% 来自这类学校。（有趣的是，哈佛大学的这一比例明显更低，约为 28%。）显然，这是一个巨大的漏洞。但至少这个漏洞似乎在缩小，而不是扩大。</p>
<p>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming that their system can’t be hacked, measure the degree to which it is.</p>
<p>或许大学招生流程的设计者应该从计算机安全的例子中吸取教训，不要只是假设他们的系统不会被 “黑客攻击”，而应该去衡量被攻击的程度。</p>
