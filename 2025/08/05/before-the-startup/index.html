<p>October 2014</p>
<p>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman’s startup class at Stanford. It’s intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</p>
<p>（本文改编自我在斯坦福大学山姆・奥特曼创业课上的客座演讲。内容虽面向大学生，但其中很多观点也适用于其他年龄段的潜在创业者。）</p>
<p>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself “what would I tell my own kids?” My kids are little, but I can imagine what I’d tell them about startups if they were in college, and that’s what I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p>有孩子的好处之一是，当你需要给出建议时，你可以问自己：“我会对自己的孩子说什么？” 我的孩子还小，但我能想象如果他们上了大学，我会跟他们讲哪些关于创业的事 —— 接下来我要讲的就是这些。</p>
<p>Startups are very counterintuitive. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s just because knowledge about them hasn’t permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can’t always trust your instincts.</p>
<p>创业这件事非常反直觉。我不确定原因何在，或许是因为关于创业的知识还没渗透到我们的文化中。但无论如何，创业时，你不能总相信自己的直觉。</p>
<p>It’s like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. Eventually you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort. At first there’s a list of things you’re trying to remember as you start down the hill.</p>
<p>这有点像滑雪。第一次滑雪时，你想减速，直觉会让你向后仰。但滑雪时向后仰，你只会失控地冲下山坡。所以学滑雪的一部分内容，就是学会抑制这种冲动。最终你会养成新习惯，但一开始必须有意识地努力 —— 刚开始下坡时，你得时刻记着一长串注意事项。</p>
<p>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there’s a similar list for startups. Here I’m going to give you the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.</p>
<p>创业和滑雪一样 “违背天性”，所以也有这么一串注意事项。接下来我要说的是第一部分 —— 如果你想为创业做准备，需要记住这些事。</p>
<p><strong>Counterintuitive</strong></p>
<p><strong>反直觉</strong></p>
<p>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you’ll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.</p>
<p>第一条就是我已经提到的：创业太特殊了，如果你相信直觉，会犯很多错。哪怕你只知道这一点，至少在犯错前会犹豫一下。</p>
<p>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. It’s really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they’re about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come back a year later and say “I wish we’d listened.”</p>
<p>我运营 Y Combinator 时，常开玩笑说我们的作用就是告诉创始人一些他们会无视的事。这话千真万确。一批又一批创业者，YC 的合伙人会警告他们即将犯下的错误，他们不听，一年后回来却说：“真该听你们的。”</p>
<p>Why do the founders ignore the partners’ advice? Well, that’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to disregard them. And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but part of its raison d’etre. If founders’ instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn’t need us. You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That’s why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors. [1]</p>
<p>为什么创始人会无视合伙人的建议？这就是反直觉观点的特点：它们和你的直觉相悖，看起来是错的。所以你第一反应肯定是无视。其实我那句玩笑不只是 YC 的 “魔咒”，更是它存在的意义。如果创始人的直觉本身就能给出正确答案，他们就不需要我们了。你只需要那些能给你带来意外启发的建议。这也是滑雪教练很多，而跑步教练很少的原因。[1]</p>
<p>You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say “I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.”</p>
<p>不过，你可以相信自己对人的直觉。事实上，年轻创业者最常犯的错误之一，就是不够相信这种直觉。他们会和那些看起来很厉害，但自己私下里有点疑虑的人合作。后来出问题时，他们会说：“我早觉得他有点不对劲，但他看起来太厉害了，我就没在意。”</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don’t ignore it.</p>
<p>如果你考虑和某人合作 —— 无论是作为联合创始人、员工、投资者还是收购方 —— 并且对他们有疑虑，相信你的直觉。如果某人看起来油滑、虚伪或混蛋，别无视这种感觉。</p>
<p>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you’ve known long enough to be sure.</p>
<p>这种情况下，“任性” 一点是值得的。和你真心喜欢、且认识足够久能信任的人一起工作。</p>
<p><strong>Expertise</strong></p>
<p><strong>专业知识</strong></p>
<p>The second counterintuitive point is that it’s not that important to know a lot about startups. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you’re solving for them. Mark Zuckerberg didn’t succeed because he was an expert on startups. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he understood his users really well.</p>
<p>第二个反直觉的点是：懂多少创业知识没那么重要。在创业中成功的关键，不是成为创业专家，而是成为用户和你要解决的问题的专家。马克・扎克伯格能成功，不是因为他是创业专家。他完全是创业新手，却能成功，因为他太了解自己的用户了。</p>
<p>If you don’t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don’t feel bad on that account. That sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you’ve done it.</p>
<p>比如，如果你根本不知道怎么进行天使轮融资，别为此懊恼。这类事需要时能学会，做完后也能忘掉。</p>
<p>In fact, I worry it’s not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn’t think “here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.” It would set off alarms. Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that’s actually essential: making something people want.</p>
<p>其实我担心的是，深入学习创业机制不仅没必要，甚至可能有点危险。如果我遇到一个本科生，他对可转换票据、员工协议，甚至（老天保佑）FF 级股票了如指掌，我不会觉得 “这人比同龄人领先太多”，反而会警觉。因为年轻创业者还有一个典型错误：走创业的 “流程”。他们编一个听起来合理的想法，以不错的估值融到钱，租个酷炫的办公室，雇一群人。从表面看，这就是创业该做的事。但租完办公室、雇好人之后，下一步就是：逐渐意识到自己彻底完蛋了 —— 因为他们模仿了创业的所有外在形式，却忽略了唯一真正重要的事：做出人们需要的东西。</p>
<p><strong>Game</strong></p>
<p><strong>游戏思维</strong></p>
<p>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that’s what they’ve been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point. Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Extracurricular activities, check. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.</p>
<p>这种事我们见得太多，以至于给它起了个名字：“过家家”。后来我才明白为什么会这样。年轻创业者走创业流程，是因为这是他们迄今为止的人生中被训练做的事。比如，想想你为了上大学要做什么：课外活动，打勾。甚至大学课程里的大部分作业，都像绕圈跑步一样虚假。</p>
<p>I’m not attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when you’re being taught something, and if you measure their performance it’s inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point where much of what you’re measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.</p>
<p>我不是在攻击教育体系。当你在学习时，做的事总会有一定虚假性；而当你要衡量表现时，人们不可避免地会利用这种虚假性，以至于你衡量的很多东西，其实都是虚假的产物。</p>
<p>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions. The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the main thing I’d be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would turn up on the exam. It was like a game.</p>
<p>坦白说，我在大学时也这么干过。我发现很多课程里，可能只有二三十个概念适合出成考题。我备考的方式不是（至少不只是）掌握课程内容，而是列出可能的考题，提前想好答案。走进期末考试考场时，我最想知道的是自己押的题能中多少。这就像一场游戏。</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders’ first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors. We tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that’s actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so. Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. And we have to tell them the best way to do that is simply to make something people want.</p>
<p>所以，当年轻创业者被训练了一辈子玩这种 “游戏” 后，他们创业的第一反应就是想找出赢得这场新 “游戏” 的诀窍，这并不奇怪。因为融资似乎成了衡量创业成功的标准（另一个典型的新手错误），他们总想问说服投资者的诀窍。我们告诉他们，说服投资者的最好方式，是让创业公司真的做得好 —— 也就是快速增长，然后如实告诉投资者。接着他们又想知道快速增长的诀窍。我们只能告诉他们，最好的方式就是做出人们需要的东西。</p>
<p>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders begin with the founder asking “How do we…” and the partner replying “Just…”</p>
<p>YC 合伙人与年轻创业者的很多对话，都是从创业者问 “我们该怎么……” 开始，合伙人回答 “只要……” 结束。</p>
<p>Why do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they’re looking for the trick.</p>
<p>为什么创业者总把事情搞得这么复杂？我意识到，因为他们在找 “诀窍”。</p>
<p>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. [2] But that doesn’t work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.</p>
<p>所以创业的第三个反直觉之处是：创业是 “钻空子” 思维失效的地方。如果你去大公司工作，“钻空子” 可能还管用。取决于公司有多混乱，你可以靠拍对马屁、装出高效的样子等方式成功。[2] 但这在创业中没用。没有老板可以糊弄，只有用户，而用户只关心你的产品是否满足他们的需求。创业像物理一样客观：你必须做出人们需要的东西，且只有在做到这一点时才能发展。</p>
<p>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you’re super good at sounding like you know what you’re talking about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two rounds of funding. But it’s not in your interest to. The company is ultimately doomed. All you’re doing is wasting your own time riding it down.</p>
<p>危险的是，“装样子” 在投资者那里多少有点用。如果你特别擅长装得很懂行，至少能骗到一轮融资，甚至两轮。但这对你没好处。公司最终注定失败，你只是在浪费自己的时间陪它走向终结。</p>
<p>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder who has made something users love is the one who will go on to succeed after raising the money.</p>
<p>所以别再找诀窍了。创业中确实有诀窍，任何领域都有，但它们的重要性比解决实际问题低一个数量级。一个不懂融资，但做出了用户喜爱的产品的创始人，比一个精通所有融资技巧，但用户增长停滞的创始人更容易融到钱。更重要的是，做出用户喜爱的产品的创始人，融资后才能继续成功。</p>
<p>Though in a sense it’s bad news in that you’re deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I think it’s exciting that gaming the system stops working when you start a startup. It’s exciting that there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work. Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do. [3] I would have been delighted if I’d realized in college that there were parts of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others, and a few where it hardly mattered at all. But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things to consider when you’re thinking about your future. How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4]</p>
<p>虽然从某种角度说，不能再用 “钻空子” 这种强大武器有点遗憾，但我觉得创业中 “钻空子” 失效这件事很令人兴奋。世界上居然有这样的领域，你靠做好工作就能成功，这太让人激动了。想象一下，如果世界全像学校和大公司那样 —— 你要么花大量时间做无用功，要么输给那些做无用功的人 —— 那该多令人沮丧。[3] 如果我在大学时就意识到，现实世界中有些领域 “钻空子” 没那么重要，甚至几乎不重要，我会很高兴。但这样的领域确实存在，而在思考未来时，这种差异是你需要考虑的最重要的事之一：在每种工作中，你要靠什么成功？你希望靠什么成功？[4]</p>
<p><strong>All-Consuming</strong></p>
<p><strong>全身心投入</strong></p>
<p>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here.</p>
<p>这就引出了第四个反直觉的点：创业会占据你的全部生活。如果你创业，它对你生活的占据程度会超出你的想象。如果创业成功，它会占据你的生活很长时间：至少好几年，可能十年，甚至整个职业生涯。所以这里有实实在在的机会成本。</p>
<p>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable. Basically at 25 he started running as fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn’t stopped to catch his breath since. Every day new shit happens in the Google empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week’s backlog of shit accumulates. And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company’s daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives. Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who’ve done it.</p>
<p>拉里・佩奇的生活似乎很令人羡慕，但也有不那么令人羡慕的地方。基本上，他 25 岁时就开始拼命奔跑，而且从那以后似乎就没停下来喘过气。谷歌帝国每天都有新麻烦，只有 CEO 能处理，而他作为 CEO，必须去处理。哪怕休假一周，就会堆积一周的麻烦。他还得毫无怨言地承受这一切，部分原因是作为公司的 “大家长”，他不能表现出恐惧或软弱；另一部分原因是，亿万富翁抱怨生活艰难，只会得到零甚至负的同情。这就产生了一个奇怪的副作用：成功创业者的艰难，几乎只有亲身经历过的人才知道。</p>
<p>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. You’re worrying about construction delays at your London office instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.</p>
<p>YC 投资过几家能称为 “巨大成功” 的公司，每一家的创始人都说过同样的话：创业从来不会变轻松。问题的性质会变 —— 你担心的可能是伦敦办公室的建设延期，而不是工作室公寓里坏掉的空调 —— 但担忧的总量从未减少，甚至可能增加。</p>
<p>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it’s like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably. And while it’s truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have them than after. Many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in rich countries do.</p>
<p>成功创业有点像生孩子：按下按钮，你的生活就会发生不可逆转的改变。虽然生孩子真的很美好，但很多事在生孩子前做比生完后更容易，其中很多事还能让你成为更好的父母。而因为可以推迟 “按下按钮”，富裕国家的大多数人都会这么做。</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they’re supposed to start them while they’re still in college. Are you crazy? And what are the universities thinking? They go out of their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives, and yet they’re setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.</p>
<p>但说到创业，很多人似乎觉得应该在大学时就开始。你疯了吗？大学在想什么？他们费尽心思确保学生能拿到避孕药，却又到处搞创业项目和创业孵化器。</p>
<p>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming students are interested in startups. Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers. So students who want to start startups hope universities can teach them about startups. And whether universities can do this or not, there’s some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.</p>
<p>公平地说，大学也是迫不得已。很多新生对创业感兴趣，而大学至少在事实上被期望为学生的职业生涯做准备。所以想创业的学生希望大学能教他们创业知识。不管大学能不能做到，都有压力让它们宣称自己能做到，否则就会有学生流向那些宣称能教创业的大学。</p>
<p>Can universities teach students about startups? Yes and no. They can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know. What you need to learn about are the needs of your own users, and you can’t do that until you actually start the company. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it. And it’s impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your life. You can’t start a startup for real as a student, because if you start a startup for real you’re not a student anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won’t even be that for long. [6]</p>
<p>大学能教学生创业吗？能，也不能。它们能教关于创业的知识，但如我之前所说，这不是你需要知道的。你需要了解的是自己用户的需求，而这只有在你真正开了公司后才能做到。[5] 所以创业本质上是只能在实践中学习的事。而在大学里不可能真正创业，原因我刚才说了：创业会占据你的全部生活。作为学生，你不可能真正创业，因为一旦认真创业，你就不再是学生了。可能名义上还是学生一段时间，但也长不了。[6]</p>
<p>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take? Be a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and not be a student? I can answer that one for you. Do not start a startup in college. How to start a startup is just a subset of a bigger problem you’re trying to solve: how to have a good life. And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it. Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search. Most people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.</p>
<p>面对这种二分法，你该选哪条路？做真正的学生，不创业？还是真正创业，不当学生？我可以告诉你答案：别在大学时创业。“如何创业” 只是你要解决的更大问题的一个子集：如何拥有美好的人生。虽然对很多有野心的人来说，创业可以是美好人生的一部分，但 20 岁不是最佳时机。创业就像一场极其快速的深度优先搜索，而大多数人在 20 岁时，仍应该进行广度优先搜索。</p>
<p>You can do things in your early 20s that you can’t do as well before or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline. For unambitious people, this sort of thing is the dreaded “failure to launch,” but for the ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration. If you start a startup at 20 and you’re sufficiently successful, you’ll never get to do it. [7]</p>
<p>二十出头时，你能做一些之前和之后都做不好的事：凭一时兴起深入投入某个项目，或者毫无时间压力地超低价旅行。对没野心的人来说，这种事是可怕的 “停滞不前”，但对有野心的人来说，这可能是无比宝贵的探索。如果你 20 岁创业且足够成功，就再也没机会做这些事了。[7]</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. He can do other things most people can’t, like charter jets to fly him to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he’s running Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life’s work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life’s work from.</p>
<p>马克・扎克伯格永远不会有在异国他乡闲逛的经历了。他能做很多人做不到的事，比如包机去国外，但成功夺走了他生活中很多偶然性。 Facebook 在运营他，就像他在运营 Facebook 一样。虽然被一个你视为毕生事业的项目 “掌控” 可能很酷，但偶然性也有其优势，尤其是在人生早期。比如，它能给你更多选择，让你从中挑选毕生事业。</p>
<p>There’s not even a tradeoff here. You’re not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you’re more likely to succeed if you wait. In the unlikely case that you’re 20 and one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you’ll face a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run with it. But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it’s gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.</p>
<p>这甚至算不上权衡。20 岁时放弃创业，你不会损失什么，因为等一等，你成功的可能性更高。万一你 20 岁时，某个副业像 Facebook 那样爆发，你会面临选择：要不要全力以赴。这种情况下，全力以赴可能是合理的。但创业通常需要创始人推动才能发展，而 20 岁就这么做，实在是没必要的愚蠢。</p>
<p><strong>Try</strong></p>
<p><strong>尝试</strong></p>
<p>Should you do it at any age? I realize I’ve made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven’t, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard. What if it’s too hard? How can you tell if you’re up to this challenge?</p>
<p>那任何年龄都该创业吗？我意识到自己把创业说得挺难的。如果还没说清楚，我再强调一次：创业真的很难。如果太难了呢？你怎么知道自己能否应对这个挑战？</p>
<p>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can’t tell. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. But unless you’ve had a very strange life you haven’t done much that was like being a startup founder. Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you’re trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?</p>
<p>答案是第五个反直觉的点：你不知道。到目前为止的人生，可能让你大致知道自己成为数学家或职业足球运动员的前景如何。但除非你的人生非常奇特，否则你没做过多少和创业类似的事。创业会极大地改变你。所以你要评估的不仅是现在的自己，还有未来可能成长为的样子 —— 谁能做到这一点呢？</p>
<p>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold. The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become. There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much. I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.</p>
<p>过去 9 年，我的工作就是预测人们是否有能力创办成功的公司。判断他们有多聪明很容易，读这篇文章的大多数人都超过了这个门槛。难的是预测他们会变得多坚韧、多有野心。可能没人比我更有经验做这种预测了，所以我可以告诉你，专家能知道多少 —— 答案是：不多。我学会了对每批创业公司中哪些会成为明星保持完全开放的心态。</p>
<p>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator just as they’ve aced every one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they’ve faced in life so far. Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn’t discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them. But there is little correlation between founders’ initial attitudes and how well their companies do.</p>
<p>创始人自己有时觉得知道答案。有些人来的时候，确信自己能在 YC 表现出色，就像他们在人生中遇到的所有（少数、虚假、简单的）测试中表现出色一样。另一些人来的时候，疑惑自己怎么会被选中，担心 YC 会发现接受他们是个错误。但创始人最初的态度和公司最终的表现几乎没什么关联。</p>
<p>I’ve read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.</p>
<p>我读过一些关于军队的内容 —— 那些昂首阔步的新兵，并不比安静的新兵更可能成为真正坚韧的人。原因可能相同：军队的考验和他们之前经历的完全不同。</p>
<p>If you’re absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn’t do it. But if you’re merely unsure whether you’re up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.</p>
<p>如果你对创业极度恐惧，可能确实不该做。但如果你只是不确定自己能否应对，唯一的办法就是尝试。只是现在别试。</p>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<p><strong>想法</strong></p>
<p>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.</p>
<p>所以如果你某天想创业，大学时该做什么？最初只需要两样东西：一个想法和联合创始人。而获得这两样东西的方法是一样的。这就引出了第六个，也是最后一个反直觉的点：获取创业想法的方式，不是刻意去想创业想法。</p>
<p>I’ve written a whole essay on this, so I won’t repeat it all here. But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you’ll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they’re bad.</p>
<p>我专门写过一篇文章讲这个，这里就不重复了。但简而言之，如果你刻意去想创业想法，想出来的不仅会很糟，还会糟得听起来很合理 —— 这意味着你会在意识到它们很糟之前，浪费大量时间。</p>
<p>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don’t even realize at first that they’re startup ideas.</p>
<p>想出好的创业想法的方法是退一步。不要刻意去想，而是把自己的大脑变成那种能无意识产生创业想法的类型。事实上，无意识到你一开始甚至没意识到它们是创业想法。</p>
<p>This is not only possible, it’s how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.</p>
<p>这不仅可能，苹果、雅虎、谷歌和 Facebook 都是这么来的。这些公司最初都没打算成为公司，只是副业。最好的创业公司几乎都得从副业开始，因为好想法往往太非主流，你的意识会拒绝把它们当成创业想法。</p>
<p>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.</p>
<p>那么，如何把自己的大脑变成能无意识产生创业想法的类型？（1）大量学习重要的东西；（2）解决你感兴趣的问题；（3）和你喜欢且尊重的人一起。顺便说一句，第三点也是同时找到联合创始人的方法。</p>
<p>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of “learn a lot about things that matter,” I wrote “become good at some technology.” But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology. They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen. So you don’t have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.</p>
<p>我第一次写这段话时，把 “大量学习重要的东西” 写成了 “精通某项技术”。但这个说法虽然充分，却太狭隘了。布莱恩・切斯基和乔・格比亚的特别之处，不是他们精通技术，而是他们擅长设计，或许更重要的是，他们擅长组织团队、推动项目落地。所以你不一定非要做技术相关的事，只要你解决的问题足够有挑战性，能让你成长就行。</p>
<p>What kind of problems are those? That is very hard to answer in the general case. History is full of examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the time thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn’t think were important. On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right. So how do you know when you’re working on real stuff? [8]</p>
<p>哪些问题是这样的？总体来说很难回答。历史上满是这样的例子：年轻人在做一些当时没人觉得重要的事，尤其是他们的父母不觉得重要的事。但另一方面，历史上更多的例子是：父母觉得孩子在浪费时间，结果确实如此。那你怎么知道自己在做的是 “正经事”？[8]</p>
<p>I know how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they’re supposed to be important.</p>
<p>我知道自己怎么判断。真正的问题是有趣的，而我有点 “任性”—— 我总想做有趣的事，哪怕没人在乎（事实上，尤其是没人在乎的时候），而让我做无聊的事，哪怕别人说很重要，我也很难做到。</p>
<p>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful in some worldly way. Y Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. But I don’t know what other people have in their heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup. And indeed, probably also the best way to live. [9]</p>
<p>我的人生中有很多例子：我因为觉得某事有趣而去做，后来发现它在现实中很有用。YC 本身就是我因为觉得有趣才做的。所以我似乎有个内在的指南针帮我。但我不知道别人的脑子里有什么。或许再想想，我能总结出一些识别真正有趣的问题的方法，但目前我能给的最好建议，虽然有点循环论证，就是：如果你对真正有趣的问题有感觉，那么积极地追随这种感觉，就是为创业做准备的最好方式。事实上，这可能也是最好的生活方式。[9]</p>
<p>But although I can’t explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them. If you think of technology as something that’s spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to “live in the future.” When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they’re startup ideas, but you’ll know they’re something that ought to exist.</p>
<p>虽然我没法笼统地解释什么是有趣的问题，但我可以告诉你一大部分这类问题。如果你把技术看作一种像分形污渍一样蔓延的东西，那么边缘上每一个移动的点都代表一个有趣的问题。所以，让自己的大脑产生好的创业想法的一个可靠方法，是让自己站在某项技术的前沿 —— 用保罗・布赫海特的话说，就是 “活在未来”。当你达到那个境界，那些在别人看来不可思议的前瞻性想法，对你来说会很明显。你可能没意识到它们是创业想法，但你会知道它们应该存在。</p>
<p>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. He didn’t mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get started.</p>
<p>比如，90 年代中期，我在哈佛的朋友罗伯特和特雷弗有个同学，自己写了 IP 语音软件。他没打算用它创业，也从没尝试把它变成公司。他只是想和在台湾的女朋友通话，又不想付长途话费，而作为网络专家，对他来说，把声音转换成数据包通过互联网发送，是很自然的做法。他的软件只用来和女朋友通话，没做其他事，但这正是最好的创业公司开始的方式。</p>
<p>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on “entrepreneurship.” It’s the classic version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that’s what you’ll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations. [10]</p>
<p>所以奇怪的是，如果你想成为成功的创业者，大学时最该做的，不是那种专注于 “创业” 的新型职业教育，而是经典的、为教育而教育的大学模式。如果你想毕业后创业，大学时该做的是学习有力量的知识。如果你有真正的求知欲，追随自己的兴趣，自然就会这么做。[10]</p>
<p>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.</p>
<p>创业中真正重要的是领域专长。成为拉里・佩奇的方法，是成为搜索领域的专家；而成为搜索领域专家的方法，是被真正的好奇心驱动，而非别有用心。</p>
<p>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you’ll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.</p>
<p>最好的情况是，创业只是好奇心的 “副产品”。而如果你把这个 “副产品” 的念头放在过程的末尾，会做得最好。</p>
<p>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.</p>
<p>所以，给年轻的潜在创业者的最终建议，浓缩成两个词：学习就好。</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.</p>
<p>[1] 有些创始人更愿意倾听，这往往是成功的预兆。我记得 Airbnb 的创始人在 YC 期间，听得非常认真。</p>
<p>[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. If big companies weren’t plagued by internal inefficiencies, they’d be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.</p>
<p>[2] 事实上，这也是创业有可能存在的原因之一。如果大公司没有内部低效，它们的效率会成比例地更高，留给创业公司的空间就会更少。</p>
<p>[3] In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on schleps, but this sort of work is merely unglamorous, not bogus.</p>
<p>[3] 创业中你确实要花很多时间做琐碎的事，但这种工作只是不风光，并非无用。</p>
<p>[4] What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system? Management consulting.</p>
<p>[4] 如果你真正的志向是 “钻空子”，那就去做管理咨询吧。</p>
<p>[5] The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get significant numbers of users, you’ve started it, whether you realize it yet or not.</p>
<p>[5] 公司可能还没注册，但如果你开始有大量用户，不管你有没有意识到，你已经创业了。</p>
<p>[6] It shouldn’t be that surprising that colleges can’t teach students how to be good startup founders, because they can’t teach them how to be good employees either.</p>
<p>The way universities “teach” students how to be employees is to hand off the task to companies via internship programs. But you couldn’t do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never come back.</p>
<p>[6] 大学教不会学生如何成为优秀的创业者，这并不奇怪，因为它们也教不会学生如何成为优秀的员工。大学 “教” 学生如何成为员工的方式，是通过实习项目把这个任务交给公司。但对创业来说，没法这么做 —— 因为按理说，如果学生做得好，就再也不会回来了。</p>
<p>[7] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. It was only because he was otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he could accept it. And yet if he hadn’t we probably would not know his name.</p>
<p>[7] 查尔斯・达尔文 22 岁时，收到了作为博物学家乘坐 “贝格尔号” 航行的邀请。当时他无所事事，程度甚至让家人担心，所以才能接受邀请。而如果他没接受，我们可能根本不会知道他的名字。</p>
<p>[8] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department. There are some whose definition of important problems includes only those on the critical path to med school.</p>
<p>[8] 父母在这方面有时尤其保守。有些父母认为，只有通往医学院的关键路径上的问题才是重要的。</p>
<p>[9] I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring ideas intolerable. Could you endure studying literary theory, or working in middle management at a large company?</p>
<p>[9] 我确实想到了一个判断你是否对有趣的想法有感觉的方法：你是否无法忍受已知的无聊想法。你能忍受研究文学理论，或在大公司做中层管理吗？</p>
<p>[10] In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little about how the courses they took might look to an employer. And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA. Good news: users don’t care what your GPA was. And I’ve never heard of investors caring either. Y Combinator certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades you got in them.</p>
<p>[10] 事实上，如果你的目标是创业，你可以比前几代人更贴近通识教育的理想。过去，学生主要关注毕业后找工作，至少会有点在意选的课程在雇主看来怎么样。甚至更糟，他们可能会避开难的课程，怕成绩低影响至关重要的 GPA。好消息是：用户不在乎你的 GPA，我也从没听说投资者在乎。YC 肯定不会问你大学上了什么课，成绩如何。</p>
