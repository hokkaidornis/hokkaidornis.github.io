<p>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporated an earlier talk at Northeastern.)<br>（本文改编自哈佛大学的一次客座讲座，其中融入了之前在东北大学的一次演讲内容。）</p>
<p>When I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work– that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.<br>当我从计算机科学研究生院毕业时，我去了艺术学校学习绘画。很多人似乎对一个对计算机感兴趣的人同时也对绘画感兴趣感到惊讶。他们似乎认为，黑客技术和绘画是截然不同的工作 —— 黑客技术是冰冷、精确且有条理的，而绘画是某种原始冲动的狂热表达。</p>
<p>Both of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In fact, of all the different types of people I’ve known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.<br>这两种印象都是错误的。黑客技术和绘画有很多共同点。事实上，在我认识的所有不同类型的人中，黑客和画家是最相似的群体之一。</p>
<p>What hackers and painters have in common is that they’re both makers. Along with composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things. They’re not doing research per se, though if in the course of trying to make good things they discover some new technique, so much the better.<br>黑客和画家的共同点在于，他们都是创作者。和作曲家、建筑师、作家一样，黑客和画家努力做的事情是创造优秀的作品。他们本身并不是在做研究，不过如果在努力创造优秀作品的过程中发现了某种新技术，那再好不过了。</p>
<p>I’ve never liked the term “computer science.” The main reason I don’t like it is that there’s no such thing. Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they’re doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have people working on something like the natural history of computers– studying the behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And then at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It’s as if mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same department.<br>我一直不喜欢 “计算机科学” 这个术语。主要原因是，根本不存在 “计算机科学” 这种东西。计算机科学是一个由历史偶然事件拼凑起来的、包含多个勉强相关领域的大杂烩，就像南斯拉夫一样。一端是那些实际上是数学家的人，却把自己做的事称为计算机科学，这样他们就能获得美国国防部高级研究计划局的资助。中间是那些研究类似 “计算机自然史” 的人 —— 比如研究网络数据路由算法的行为。而另一端，则是黑客们，他们试图编写有趣的软件，对他们来说，计算机只是一种表达媒介，就像混凝土之于建筑师、颜料之于画家一样。这就好比数学家、物理学家和建筑师都必须隶属于同一个院系。</p>
<p>Sometimes what the hackers do is called “software engineering,” but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it’s there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.<br>有时，黑客所做的事情被称为 “软件工程”，但这个术语同样具有误导性。优秀的软件设计师并不比建筑师更像工程师。建筑学和工程学之间的界限并不清晰，但它确实存在。这条界限存在于 “做什么” 和 “怎么做” 之间：建筑师决定做什么，工程师则想办法怎么做。</p>
<p>What and how should not be kept too separate. You’re asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to implement some spec. At its best, it’s creating the spec– though it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.<br>“做什么” 和 “怎么做” 不应该分得太开。如果不理解怎么做就试图决定做什么，那就是自找麻烦。但黑客技术肯定不只是决定如何实现某个规范。在最佳状态下，它是在创造规范 —— 尽管事实证明，创造规范的最佳方式就是去实现它。</p>
<p>Perhaps one day “computer science” will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its component parts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it meant independence for my native land, hacking.<br>也许有一天，“计算机科学” 会像南斯拉夫一样，分裂成它的组成部分。这或许是件好事。尤其是如果这意味着我所在的 “领地”—— 黑客技术 —— 能获得独立的话。</p>
<p>Bundling all these different types of work together in one department may be convenient administratively, but it’s confusing intellectually. That’s the other reason I don’t like the name “computer science.” Arguably the people in the middle are doing something like an experimental science. But the people at either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.<br>把所有这些不同类型的工作捆绑在一个院系里，在行政上可能很方便，但在学术上却令人困惑。这是我不喜欢 “计算机科学” 这个名称的另一个原因。可以说，中间那部分人在做类似实验科学的工作。但两端的人 —— 黑客和数学家 —— 实际上并不是在做科学研究。</p>
<p>The mathematicians don’t seem bothered by this. They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says &#96;&#96;computer science’’ on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what they’re doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.<br>数学家们似乎并不为此困扰。他们像数学系的其他数学家一样，愉快地投入到定理证明中，或许很快就不再注意到他们工作的大楼外面写着 “计算机科学”。但对黑客来说，这个标签是个问题。如果他们所做的事情被称为科学，会让他们觉得自己应该表现得像搞科学的。因此，大学里和研究实验室里的黑客们，本想设计优秀的软件，却觉得自己应该去写研究论文。</p>
<p>In the best case, the papers are just a formality. Hackers write cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software. But often this mismatch causes problems. It’s easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.<br>最好的情况下，论文只是一种形式。黑客写出很棒的软件，然后写一篇关于它的论文，论文成了软件所代表的成就的替代物。但这种错位往往会引发问题。人们很容易从创造美好的事物，转向创造那些更适合作为研究论文主题的丑陋事物。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, beautiful things don’t always make the best subjects for papers. Number one, research must be original– and as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to be sure that you’re exploring virgin territory is to stake out a piece of ground that no one wants. Number two, research must be substantial– and awkward systems yield meatier papers, because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome in order to get things done. Nothing yields meaty problems like starting with the wrong assumptions. Most of AI is an example of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent abstract concepts, you’ll have a lot of papers to write about how to make this work. As Ricky Ricardo used to say, “Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do.”<br>不幸的是，美好的事物并不总是最适合作为论文主题。第一，研究必须具有原创性 —— 任何写过博士论文的人都知道，确保自己在探索处女地的方法，是圈出一块没人想要的领域。第二，研究必须有实质内容 —— 蹩脚的系统能产出更有分量的论文，因为你可以写为了完成任务必须克服的障碍。没有什么比从错误的假设出发更能产生有分量的问题了。人工智能的大部分研究就是这个规则的例子：如果你假设知识可以表示为一系列谓词逻辑表达式，其参数代表抽象概念，那么你就有很多关于如何让这一假设奏效的论文可写。就像瑞奇・里卡多曾经说的：“露西，你有很多要解释的。”</p>
<p>The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. This kind of work is hard to convey in a research paper.<br>创造美好事物的方式，往往是对已有的东西做细微调整，或者以一种稍新的方式组合现有想法。这种工作很难在研究论文中体现出来。</p>
<p>So why do universities and research labs continue to judge hackers by publications? For the same reason that “scholastic aptitude” gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code. These tests are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test that kind of works.<br>那么，为什么大学和研究实验室仍然用论文发表来评判黑客呢？原因和 “学术能力” 用头脑简单的标准化测试来衡量，或者程序员的生产力用代码行数来衡量是一样的。这些测试容易实施，而没有什么比一个看似有效的简单测试更诱人的了。</p>
<p>Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing beautiful software, would be much more difficult. You need a good sense of design to judge good design. And there is no correlation, except possibly a negative one, between people’s ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can.<br>衡量黑客真正在努力做的事情 —— 设计优秀的软件 —— 要困难得多。评判优秀的设计需要良好的设计感。而人们识别优秀设计的能力，与他们对自己能做到这一点的信心之间，没有相关性，甚至可能是负相关。</p>
<p>The only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded. Unfortunately, the amounts of time involved can be longer than human lifetimes. Samuel Johnson said it took a hundred years for a writer’s reputation to converge. You have to wait for the writer’s influential friends to die, and then for all their followers to die.<br>唯一的外部检验是时间。随着时间的推移，美好的事物往往会蓬勃发展，而丑陋的事物则会被抛弃。不幸的是，所需的时间可能比人的寿命还要长。塞缪尔・约翰逊说过，一个作家的声誉需要一百年才能稳定下来。你得等作家那些有影响力的朋友去世，然后等他们所有的追随者去世。</p>
<p>I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random component in their reputations. In this they are no different from other makers. In fact, they’re lucky by comparison. The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it is in painting.<br>我认为，黑客们只能接受自己的声誉中存在很大的随机性。在这一点上，他们和其他创作者没有区别。事实上，相比之下他们是幸运的。时尚对黑客技术的影响，远不如对绘画的影响大。</p>
<p>There are worse things than having people misunderstand your work. A worse danger is that you will yourself misunderstand your work. Related fields are where you go looking for ideas. If you find yourself in the computer science department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example, that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer science is the theory of. All the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory, and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that stuff within three weeks of the final exam.<br>比让别人误解你的工作更糟糕的事情还有很多。更危险的是你自己误解自己的工作。相关领域是你寻找灵感的地方。例如，如果你身处计算机科学系，很自然会倾向于认为，黑客技术是理论计算机科学的应用版本。在研究生院的那段时间里，我心里一直有种不安的感觉：我应该多学点理论，而我在期末考试后三周内就把那些东西全忘了，这实在是太疏忽了。</p>
<p>Now I realize I was mistaken. Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry. You need to know how to calculate time and space complexity and about Turing completeness. You might also want to remember at least the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression library. Painters in fact have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than that.<br>现在我意识到我错了。黑客需要理解计算理论的程度，就像画家需要理解颜料化学一样。你需要知道如何计算时间和空间复杂度，以及图灵完备性。你可能还需要至少记住状态机的概念，以防万一要写解析器或正则表达式库。事实上，画家需要记住的颜料化学知识比这多得多。</p>
<p>I’ve found that the best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have the word “computer” in their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers. Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the theory of computation.<br>我发现，最好的灵感来源不是其他名字里带 “计算机” 的领域，而是其他由创作者构成的领域。绘画比计算理论能提供丰富得多的灵感。</p>
<p>For example, I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer. I found that I did not program this way. I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging.<br>例如，我在大学里学到的是，应该在靠近电脑之前，在纸上把程序完全构思好。但我发现我不是这样编程的。我喜欢坐在电脑前编程，而不是对着一张纸。更糟的是，我没有耐心写出完整的程序并确保它是正确的，而是倾向于先写出一堆漏洞百出的代码，然后逐渐把它修改成型。我学到的是，调试是最后一步，用来找出拼写错误和疏忽。但以我的工作方式来看，编程似乎就是由调试组成的。</p>
<p>For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn’t hold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you’re writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do.<br>很长一段时间里，我为此感到内疚，就像我曾经因为没有按照小学教的方式握铅笔而感到内疚一样。如果我当时看看其他创作者，比如画家或建筑师，我就会意识到我所做的事情有一个名字：草图绘制。在我看来，大学里教我的编程方法全是错的。你应该在写程序的过程中构思程序，就像作家、画家和建筑师那样。</p>
<p>Realizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you’ve already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen. Static typing would be a fine idea if people actually did write programs the way they taught me to in college. But that’s not how any of the hackers I know write programs. We need a language that lets us scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.<br>意识到这一点对软件设计有实际意义。这意味着，编程语言首先应该具有可塑性。编程语言是用来思考程序的，而不是用来表达你已经想好的程序。它应该是铅笔，而不是钢笔。如果人们真的按照大学里教我的方式写程序，静态类型会是个好主意。但我认识的所有黑客都不是这样写程序的。我们需要一种能让我们随意涂写、修改的语言，而不是一种让你膝盖上小心翼翼放着 “类型” 茶杯，还要和编译器这位严厉的老阿姨礼貌交谈的语言。</p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of static typing, identifying with the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts the sciences: math envy. Everyone in the sciences secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are. I think mathematicians also believe this. At any rate, the result is that scientists tend to make their work look as mathematical as possible. In a field like physics this probably doesn’t do much harm, but the further you get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it becomes.<br>说到静态类型，认同自己是 “创作者” 能让我们避免另一个困扰科学界的问题：数学嫉妒。科学界的每个人都暗自认为数学家比自己更聪明。我觉得数学家自己也这么认为。无论如何，结果就是科学家们倾向于让自己的工作看起来尽可能像数学。在物理学这样的领域，这可能没什么危害，但离自然科学越远，这个问题就越严重。</p>
<p>A page of formulas just looks so impressive. (Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.) And so there is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say, important.<br>一页公式看起来就是那么令人印象深刻。（小贴士：想更令人印象深刻，就用希腊字母变量。）因此，人们很容易倾向于研究那些可以用形式化方法处理的问题，而不是那些，比如说，重要的问题。</p>
<p>If hackers identified with other makers, like writers and painters, they wouldn’t feel tempted to do this. Writers and painters don’t suffer from math envy. They feel as if they’re doing something completely unrelated. So are hackers, I think.<br>如果黑客认同其他创作者，比如作家和画家，他们就不会有这样的冲动。作家和画家不会有数学嫉妒。他们觉得自己在做的事情与之完全无关。我认为黑客也是如此。</p>
<p>If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing the kind of work they want to do, perhaps the place for them is in companies. Unfortunately, most companies won’t let hackers do what they want either. Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.<br>如果大学和研究实验室阻止黑客做他们想做的工作，或许公司是他们的去处。不幸的是，大多数公司也不让黑客做他们想做的事。大学和研究实验室迫使黑客成为科学家，而公司则迫使他们成为工程师。</p>
<p>I only discovered this myself quite recently. When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do. I had never liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to hack. When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it. Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code.<br>我自己也是最近才发现这一点的。雅虎收购 Viaweb 时，他们问我想做什么。我一直不太喜欢商业方面的工作，就说我只想做黑客技术相关的事。到了雅虎后，我发现对他们来说，“黑客技术” 指的是实现软件，而不是设计软件。程序员被视为技术人员，负责将产品经理的 “愿景”（如果能这么说的话）翻译成代码。</p>
<p>This seems to be the default plan in big companies. They do it because it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software, and it’s hard for the people running a company to pick these out. So instead of entrusting the future of the software to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design.<br>这似乎是大公司的默认模式。他们这么做是为了降低结果的标准差。只有一小部分黑客真正有能力设计软件，而公司管理者很难挑选出这些人。因此，大多数公司没有把软件的未来托付给一个才华横溢的黑客，而是设置成由委员会来设计，黑客们只是负责实现设计。</p>
<p>If you want to make money at some point, remember this, because this is one of the reasons startups win. Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don’t win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.<br>如果你想在某个时候赚钱，记住这一点，因为这是初创公司能获胜的原因之一。大公司想降低设计结果的标准差，是为了避免灾难。但当你抑制波动时，你既会失去低谷，也会失去高峰。这对大公司来说不是问题，因为它们的胜利不是靠做出伟大的产品，而是靠比其他大公司 “不那么糟糕”。</p>
<p>So if you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big enough that its software is designed by product managers, they’ll never be able to keep up with you. These opportunities are not easy to find, though. It’s hard to engage a big company in a design war, just as it’s hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand to hand combat. It would be pretty easy to write a better word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft, within the castle of their operating system monopoly, probably wouldn’t even notice if you did.<br>所以，如果你能想办法和一家足够大的公司展开设计战 —— 这家公司的软件是由产品经理设计的 —— 他们永远跟不上你。不过，这样的机会并不容易找到。让大公司卷入设计战很难，就像让城堡里的对手和你近身搏斗一样难。例如，写出一个比微软 Word 更好的文字处理器可能相当容易，但微软身处其操作系统垄断的城堡中，就算你做到了，他们可能也不会注意到。</p>
<p>The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That’s where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft themselves did this at the start. So did Apple. And Hewlett-Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has.<br><strong>打设计战的地方是新市场</strong>，那里还没有人建立起任何防御工事。在那里，你可以通过大胆的设计方法，让同一批人既负责设计又负责实现产品，从而大获全胜。微软一开始就是这么做的。苹果也是。惠普也是。我怀疑几乎所有成功的初创公司都是如此。</p>
<p>So one way to build great software is to start your own startup. There are two problems with this, though. One is that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software. At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I got to hack a quarter of the time. And the things I had to do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious to terrifying. I have a benchmark for this, because I once had to leave a board meeting to have some cavities filled. I remember sitting back in the dentist’s chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like I was on vacation.<br>所以，打造优秀软件的一种方式是自己创办初创公司。不过，这有两个问题。一是在初创公司里，除了写软件，你还得做很多其他事情。在 Viaweb，我如果能有四分之一的时间做黑客技术相关的工作，就觉得自己很幸运了。而另外四分之三的时间里，我要做的事情从枯燥乏味到令人恐惧不等。我有一个衡量标准，因为有一次我不得不离开董事会会议去补牙。我记得坐在牙医的椅子上，等着钻头开始工作，却感觉像是在度假。</p>
<p>The other problem with startups is that there is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that’s interesting to write. Programming languages are interesting to write, and Microsoft’s first product was one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages now. If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.<br>初创公司的另一个问题是，能赚钱的软件和写起来有趣的软件之间没有太多重叠。编程语言写起来很有趣，事实上微软的第一个产品就是编程语言，但现在没人会为编程语言付费了。如果你想赚钱，往往会被迫去解决那些太棘手、没人愿意免费解决的问题。</p>
<p>All makers face this problem. Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn’t pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in someone’s booth at a trade show. Writing novels doesn’t pay as well as writing ad copy for garbage disposals. And hacking programming languages doesn’t pay as well as figuring out how to connect some company’s legacy database to their Web server.<br>所有创作者都面临这个问题。价格由供求决定，人们对做起来有趣的事情的需求，远不如对解决个人客户日常问题的事情的需求大。在百老汇外的剧院演戏，收入远不如在贸易展上穿大猩猩服装站在别人的展位里。写小说不如为垃圾处理器写广告文案赚钱。做编程语言相关的黑客技术工作，不如解决某公司的遗留数据库与 Web 服务器的连接问题赚钱。</p>
<p>I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software, is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job. This phrase began with musicians, who perform at night. More generally, it means that you have one kind of work you do for money, and another for love.<br>我认为，在软件领域，这个问题的答案是一个几乎所有创作者都知道的概念：日常工作（day job）。这个短语始于音乐家，他们晚上演出，白天做其他工作。更一般地说，它指的是你有一份为了赚钱而做的工作，还有一份为了热爱而做的工作。</p>
<p>Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers. Painters and writers notoriously do. If you’re lucky you can get a day job that’s closely related to your real work. Musicians often seem to work in record stores. A hacker working on some programming language or operating system might likewise be able to get a day job using it. [1]<br>几乎所有创作者在职业生涯早期都有日常工作。画家和作家就是出了名的例子。如果你幸运的话，你能找到一份和你真正想做的工作密切相关的日常工作。音乐家似乎经常在唱片店工作。一个研究某种编程语言或操作系统的黑客，同样可能找到一份使用该语言或系统的日常工作。[1]</p>
<p>When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, and work on beautiful software on the side, I’m not proposing this as a new idea. This is what open-source hacking is all about. What I’m saying is that open-source is probably the right model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the other makers.<br>我说黑客应该有日常工作，同时在业余时间开发优秀软件，这并不是什么新观点。这正是开源黑客技术的核心。我想说的是，开源可能是正确的模式，因为所有其他创作者都以各自的方式印证了这一点。</p>
<p>It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant to let hackers work on open-source projects. At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone who didn’t. When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can’t do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you’ll inevitably be working on projects of your own. [2]<br>我觉得奇怪的是，竟然会有雇主不愿意让黑客参与开源项目。在 Viaweb，我们不愿意雇佣那些不参与开源项目的人。我们面试程序员时，最关心的是他们在业余时间写什么样的软件。除非你热爱一件事，否则你不可能把它做得非常好；如果你热爱黑客技术，你必然会从事自己的项目。[2]</p>
<p>Because hackers are makers rather than scientists, the right place to look for metaphors is not in the sciences, but among other kinds of makers. What else can painting teach us about hacking?<br>因为黑客是创作者而不是科学家，所以寻找隐喻的地方不应该是科学领域，而应该是其他创作者群体。绘画还能教给我们关于黑客技术的哪些东西呢？</p>
<p>One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the example of painting is how to learn to hack. You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking. Most hackers don’t learn to hack by taking college courses in programming. They learn to hack by writing programs of their own at age thirteen. Even in college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]<br>从绘画的例子中，我们可以学到（或者至少确认）的一点是如何学习黑客技术。学习绘画主要是通过实践。学习黑客技术也是如此。大多数黑客不是通过大学的编程课程学会黑客技术的。他们在 13 岁时就通过自己写程序来学习。即使在大学课堂上，学习黑客技术主要也是通过实践。[3]</p>
<p>Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing. If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you’ll find that each painting builds on things that have been learned in previous ones. When there’s something in a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.<br>因为画家会留下一系列作品，你可以看到他们是通过实践来学习的。如果按时间顺序看一位画家的作品，你会发现每一幅画都建立在之前作品所学的基础上。如果一幅画中有某个部分效果很好，你通常能在更早的某幅画中找到它的雏形，只是形式更小。</p>
<p>I think most makers work this way. Writers and architects seem to as well. Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.<br>我认为大多数创作者都是这样工作的。作家和建筑师似乎也是如此。或许黑客应该更像画家，定期从零开始，而不是多年来一直专注于一个项目，并试图把后来的想法都作为修订加入其中。</p>
<p>The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from the sciences. Scientists don’t learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. Scientists start out doing work that’s perfect, in the sense that they’re just trying to reproduce work someone else has already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point where they can do original work. Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it’s just very bad. So hackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original.<br>黑客通过实践学习黑客技术这一事实，再次表明黑客技术与科学有多么不同。科学家不是通过实践来学习科学的，而是通过做实验和习题。科学家一开始做的工作是 “完美的”，因为他们只是试图重现别人已经完成的工作。最终，他们才能达到能做原创工作的程度。而黑客从一开始就在做原创工作，只是做得很糟糕。所以，黑客是从原创开始，逐渐变好；科学家是从做好开始，逐渐原创。</p>
<p>The other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made.<br>创作者学习的另一种方式是通过范例。对画家来说，博物馆是技术的参考图书馆。数百年来，临摹大师的作品一直是画家传统教育的一部分，因为临摹会迫使你仔细观察一幅画的创作方式。</p>
<p>Writers do this too. Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them. Raymond Chandler did the same thing with detective stories.<br>作家也会这样做。本杰明・富兰克林通过总结艾迪生和斯蒂尔散文中的观点，然后试图重现这些观点来学习写作。雷蒙德・钱德勒在侦探小说上也做过同样的事。</p>
<p>Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs– not just at what they do, but the source code too. One of the less publicized benefits of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program. When I learned to program, we had to rely mostly on examples in books. The one big chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was not open source. Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions’ book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published until 1996.<br>同样，黑客可以通过研究优秀的程序来学习编程 —— 不仅要看程序的功能，还要看源代码。开源运动一个不太为人知的好处是，它让学习编程变得更容易了。我学习编程的时候，主要得依靠书中的例子。当时能获得的一大段代码是 Unix，但它也不是开源的。大多数阅读其源代码的人，都是通过约翰・莱昂斯那本书的非法复印件，这本书虽然写于 1977 年，却直到 1996 年才被允许出版。</p>
<p>Another example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual refinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.<br>我们能从绘画中借鉴的另一个例子是，绘画是通过逐步完善来创作的。绘画通常从草图开始，然后逐渐填充细节。但这不仅仅是填充的过程。有时，最初的计划被证明是错误的。无数画作在 X 光下显示，肢体被移动过，面部特征被调整过。</p>
<p>Here’s a case where we can learn from painting. I think hacking should work this way too. It’s unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect. You’re better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.<br>这是我们可以从绘画中学习的一点。我认为黑客技术也应该这样。期望一个程序的规范是完美的，这是不现实的。如果你事先承认这一点，并以允许规范随时更改的方式编写程序，会更好。</p>
<p>(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them to do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)<br>（大公司的结构使其难以做到这一点，因此这是初创公司的另一个优势所在。）</p>
<p>Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we should be just as worried about premature design– deciding too early what a program should do.<br>想必现在每个人都知道过早优化的危险。我认为我们也应该同样担心过早设计 —— 过早决定一个程序应该做什么。</p>
<p>The right tools can help us avoid this danger. A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind. Dynamic typing is a win here because you don’t have to commit to specific data representations up front. But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language very abstract. The easiest program to change is one that’s very short.<br>合适的工具可以帮助我们避免这种危险。一种好的编程语言应该像油画颜料一样，让你可以轻松改变想法。动态类型在这里是个优势，因为你不必事先确定特定的数据表示方式。但我认为，灵活性的关键是让语言非常抽象。最容易修改的程序是非常简短的程序。</p>
<p>This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has to be. For example, when Leonardo painted the portrait of Ginevra de Benci in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head. In it he carefully painted each individual leaf. Many painters might have thought, this is just something to put in the background to frame her head. No one will look that closely at it.<br>这听起来像是个悖论，但一幅伟大的画作必须超越其 “必要” 的程度。例如，列奥纳多在国家美术馆为吉内薇拉・德・本奇画肖像时，在她头后画了一丛杜松。他仔细地画出了每一片叶子。很多画家可能会想，这只是用来衬托她头部的背景，没人会看得那么仔细。</p>
<p>Not Leonardo. How hard he worked on part of a painting didn’t depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan. Relentless.<br>但列奥纳多不这么想。他在一幅画的某个部分投入多少精力，完全不取决于他预计有人会多么仔细地看这个部分。他就像迈克尔・乔丹，执着不懈。</p>
<p>Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible. When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even before they look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci. All those unseen details combine to produce something that’s just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune.<br>执着不懈会获胜，因为总体而言，那些不被注意的细节会变得引人注目。当人们走过吉内薇拉・德・本奇的肖像时，往往会立刻被它吸引，甚至在看到标签并注意到上面写着 “列奥纳多・达・芬奇” 之前就已如此。所有那些不被注意的细节结合在一起，产生了令人惊叹的效果，就像一千个几乎听不见的声音和谐地歌唱。</p>
<p>Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I’m not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that’s badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.<br>同样，伟大的软件需要对美的狂热追求。如果你深入研究优秀的软件，会发现那些永远不会有人看到的部分也是优美的。我不是说我能写出伟大的软件，但我知道，在代码方面，我的行为方式如果用在日常生活中，可能都需要吃处方药了。看到缩进糟糕的代码，或者用了难看的变量名，我会抓狂。</p>
<p>If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like someone digging a ditch. But if the hacker is a creator, we have to take inspiration into account.<br>如果黑客仅仅是一个实现者，把规范转换成代码，那么他可以像挖沟一样从一端做到另一端。但如果黑客是创作者，我们就必须考虑灵感的因素。</p>
<p>In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles. Sometimes you get excited about some new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other times nothing seems interesting.<br>在黑客技术领域，就像在绘画领域一样，工作有周期性。有时你会对某个新项目感到兴奋，想一天工作 16 个小时。其他时候，似乎没有什么事情是有趣的。</p>
<p>To do good work you have to take these cycles into account, because they’re affected by how you react to them. When you’re driving a car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling. Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling. In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine. It’s a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.<br>要做出好的工作，你必须考虑到这些周期，因为它们会受到你对其反应的影响。当你开着手动挡汽车上山时，有时必须松开离合器以避免熄火。同样，适当放松可以防止雄心壮志 “熄火”。在绘画和黑客技术中，都有一些极具挑战性的任务，也有一些令人安心的常规任务。把一些简单的任务留到你可能 “熄火” 的时刻去做，是个好主意。</p>
<p>In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging: it’s the one time that hacking is as straightforward as people think it is. You have a totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it. Your program is supposed to do x. Instead it does y. Where does it go wrong? You know you’re going to win in the end. It’s as relaxing as painting a wall.<br>在黑客技术中，这可能真的意味着积攒一些 bug。我喜欢调试：这是黑客技术像人们想象的那样简单直接的时刻。你面临一个完全受限的问题，你所要做的就是解决它。你的程序应该做 x，却做了 y。问题出在哪里？你知道最终你会成功。这就像刷墙一样令人放松。</p>
<p>The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together. A lot of the great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the museum. Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his Baptism of Christ. This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception. Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel himself.<br>绘画的例子不仅能教我们如何管理自己的工作，还能教我们如何协作。过去很多伟大的艺术作品是多人合作的成果，尽管博物馆里作品旁边可能只写着一个名字。列奥纳多曾是韦罗基奥工作室的学徒，他在韦罗基奥的《基督受洗》中画了其中一个天使。这种情况是常规，而非例外。米开朗基罗因为坚持自己画西斯廷教堂天顶的所有人物而被认为特别敬业。</p>
<p>As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts. It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the others and the background. But you never had one guy painting over the work of another.<br>据我所知，当画家们合作一幅画时，他们从不会在同一个部分工作。通常是大师画主要人物，助手画其他人物和背景。但从不会有一个人在另一个人的作品上作画。</p>
<p>I think this is the right model for collaboration in software too. Don’t push it too far. When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.<br>我认为这也是软件协作的正确模式。不要过度协作。当一段代码被三四个不同的人修改，且没有人真正 “拥有” 它时，它最终会像一个公共休息室 —— 感觉凄凉、被遗弃，还会堆积杂物。我认为，正确的协作方式是将项目分成定义清晰的模块，每个模块有明确的所有者，模块之间的接口要像编程语言一样精心设计，尽可能清晰明确。</p>
<p>Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user’s point of view.<br>和绘画一样，大多数软件是为人类受众设计的。因此，黑客和画家一样，要做出真正伟大的作品，必须有同理心。你必须能够从用户的角度看问题。</p>
<p>When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from someone else’s point of view. What this always meant in practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what I wanted. This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a point of not cultivating it.<br>小时候，我总被教导要从别人的角度看问题。但实际上，这往往意味着要做别人想做的事，而不是我想做的事。这当然给同理心起了个坏名声，我也刻意不去培养它。</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. It turns out that looking at things from other people’s point of view is practically the secret of success. It doesn’t necessarily mean being self-sacrificing. Far from it. Understanding how someone else sees things doesn’t imply that you’ll act in his interest; in some situations– in war, for example– you want to do exactly the opposite. [4]<br>天哪，我错了。事实证明，从别人的角度看问题几乎是成功的秘诀。这并不一定意味着要自我牺牲。远非如此。理解别人如何看待事物，并不意味着你会为他的利益行事；在某些情况下 —— 比如在战争中 —— 你可能想做完全相反的事。[4]</p>
<p>Most makers make things for a human audience. And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for example, because people are what people are interested in.<br>大多数创作者为人类受众创作。要吸引受众，你必须理解他们的需求。例如，几乎所有最伟大的画作都是人物画，因为人们对人感兴趣。</p>
<p>Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists. It’s hard for such people to design great software [5], because they can’t see things from the user’s point of view.<br>同理心可能是优秀黑客和伟大黑客之间最重要的区别。有些黑客很聪明，但在同理心方面几乎是唯我论者。这样的人很难设计出伟大的软件 [5]，因为他们无法从用户的角度看问题。</p>
<p>One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical question to someone without a technical background. We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart, are just comically bad at this. If someone asks them at a dinner party what a programming language is, they’ll say something like &#96;&#96;Oh, a high-level language is what the compiler uses as input to generate object code.’’ High-level language? Compiler? Object code? Someone who doesn’t know what a programming language is obviously doesn’t know what these things are, either.<br>判断一个人同理心有多强的一种方式，是看他们如何向没有技术背景的人解释技术问题。我们可能都认识这样的人：尽管在其他方面很聪明，但在这方面却糟糕得可笑。如果有人在晚宴上问他们什么是编程语言，他们会说：“哦，高级语言是编译器用来生成目标代码的输入。” 高级语言？编译器？目标代码？一个不知道什么是编程语言的人，显然也不知道这些东西是什么。</p>
<p>Part of what software has to do is explain itself. So to write good software you have to understand how little users understand. They’re going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they’re not going to read the manual. The best system I’ve ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]<br>软件必须做到的一点是自我解释。因此，要写出好的软件，你必须明白用户的理解有多有限。他们会毫无准备地使用软件，软件最好能如他们所猜测的那样工作，因为他们不会去读手册。在这方面，我见过的最好的系统是 1985 年的初代 Macintosh。它做到了软件几乎从未做到的事：就是能正常工作。[6]</p>
<p>Source code, too, should explain itself. If I could get people to remember just one quote about programming, it would be the one at the beginning of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.<br>源代码也应该能自我解释。如果我能让人们只记住一句关于编程的话，那会是《计算机程序的构造和解释》开头的那句话：</p>
<p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.<br>程序是为了让人读而写的，只是顺便让机器执行。</p>
<p>You need to have empathy not just for your users, but for your readers. It’s in your interest, because you’ll be one of them. Many a hacker has written a program only to find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea how it works. I know several people who’ve sworn off Perl after such experiences. [7]<br>你不仅需要对用户有同理心，还需要对读者有同理心。这符合你的利益，因为你自己也会是读者之一。很多黑客写了一个程序，六个月后再回头看，却发现自己完全不知道它是怎么工作的。我认识几个人，有过这样的经历后就发誓再也不用 Perl 了。[7]</p>
<p>Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places. But I don’t think there’s any correlation. You can do well in math and the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be associated. But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at empathy too. Just listen to the people who call in with questions on talk shows. They ask whatever it is they’re asking in such a roundabout way that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.<br>缺乏同理心常与智力联系在一起，甚至在某些地方形成了一种时尚。但我认为两者没有任何关联。你可以在数学和自然科学领域表现出色，而不必学习同理心，而这些领域的人往往很聪明，因此这两种特质就被联系起来了。但也有很多愚蠢的人同样缺乏同理心。听听那些在脱口秀节目中打电话提问的人就知道了。他们问问题的方式如此迂回，主持人常常不得不为他们重新表述问题。</p>
<p>So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool? After all, you only get one life. You might as well spend it working on something great.<br>那么，如果黑客技术的工作方式和绘画、写作一样，它有那么酷吗？毕竟，人只有一次生命。你不妨把它花在做一些伟大的事情上。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer. There is always a big time lag in prestige. It’s like light from a distant star. Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred years ago. At the time, no one thought these paintings were as important as we do today. It would have seemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy with the strange nose in a painting by Piero della Francesca.<br>不幸的是，这个问题很难回答。声誉总是存在很大的时间滞后。这就像来自遥远恒星的光。绘画现在有声誉，是因为五百年前人们的伟大作品。在当时，没有人认为这些画会像我们今天认为的那么重要。在当时的人看来，乌尔比诺公爵费德里科・达・蒙泰费尔特罗，有一天会主要因为在皮耶罗・德拉・弗朗切斯卡的画中长着一个奇怪的鼻子而被人记住，这似乎是很奇怪的。</p>
<p>So while I admit that hacking doesn’t seem as cool as painting now, we should remember that painting itself didn’t seem as cool in its glory days as it does now.<br>所以，虽然我承认现在看来黑客技术不如绘画酷，但我们应该记住，绘画在它的辉煌时期，也不像现在这么酷。</p>
<p>What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory days of hacking. In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed. Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born, and pushed the medium so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel.<br>我们有一定把握可以说，现在是黑客技术的辉煌时期。在大多数领域，伟大的作品都出现在早期。1430 年至 1500 年间创作的画作至今仍无与伦比。莎士比亚出现在专业戏剧诞生之时，他把这一媒介推向了极致，此后所有剧作家都不得不活在他的阴影下。阿尔布雷希特・丢勒在版画领域、简・奥斯汀在小说领域也是如此。</p>
<p>Over and over we see the same pattern. A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations. Hacking seems to be in this phase now.<br>我们一次又一次地看到同样的模式。一种新媒介出现，人们对它非常兴奋，在前几代人中就探索了它的大部分可能性。黑客技术现在似乎正处于这个阶段。</p>
<p>Painting was not, in Leonardo’s time, as cool as his work helped make it. How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new medium.<br>在列奥纳多的时代，绘画并不像他的作品所成就的那样酷。黑客技术最终会有多酷，将取决于我们能用这种新媒介做出什么。</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] The greatest damage that photography has done to painting may be the fact that it killed the best day job. Most of the great painters in history supported themselves by painting portraits.<br>[1] 摄影对绘画造成的最大伤害，或许是它毁掉了最理想的日常工作。历史上大多数伟大的画家都是靠画肖像谋生的。</p>
<p>[2] I’ve been told that Microsoft discourages employees from contributing to open-source projects, even in their spare time. But so many of the best hackers work on open-source projects now that the main effect of this policy may be to ensure that they won’t be able to hire any first-rate programmers.<br>[2] 有人告诉我，微软不鼓励员工参与开源项目，即使是在业余时间。但如今太多优秀的黑客都在从事开源项目，这一政策的主要效果可能是让他们无法招聘到任何一流的程序员。</p>
<p>[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like what you learn about books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you had in high school.<br>[3] 你在大学里学到的编程知识，很像你学到的关于书籍、衣服或约会的道理：不过是让你明白自己高中时的品味有多差。</p>
<p>[4] Here’s an example of applied empathy. At Viaweb, if we couldn’t decide between two alternatives, we’d ask, what would our competitors hate most? At one point a competitor added a feature to their software that was basically useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn’t, they made much of it in the trade press. We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless, but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own version that afternoon.<br>[4] 这是一个应用同理心的例子。在 Viaweb 时，如果我们在两个选项之间难以抉择，就会问自己：我们的竞争对手最讨厌什么？有一次，一个竞争对手在他们的软件中添加了一个基本没用的功能，但由于这是他们有而我们没有的少数功能之一，他们在行业媒体上大做文章。我们本可以解释这个功能毫无用处，但我们认为，自己实现这个功能会更让竞争对手恼火，于是那天下午就匆匆编写出了我们自己的版本。</p>
<p>[5] Except text editors and compilers. Hackers don’t need empathy to design these, because they are themselves typical users.<br>[5] 文本编辑器和编译器除外。黑客设计这些工具时不需要同理心，因为他们自己就是典型用户。</p>
<p>[6] Well, almost. They overshot the available RAM somewhat, causing much inconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed within a few months by buying an additional disk drive.<br>[6] 嗯，差不多是这样。初代 Macintosh 在可用内存上有些超标，导致频繁的磁盘交换，很不方便，但这个问题几个月内就能通过额外购买一个磁盘驱动器解决。</p>
<p>[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments. I would take Abelson and Sussman’s quote a step further. Programming languages should be designed to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers how to execute them. A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.<br>[7] 让程序易于阅读的方法，不是塞满注释。我想把艾布尔森和萨斯曼的话再推进一步：编程语言的设计应该是为了表达算法，只是顺便告诉计算机如何执行。一种好的编程语言用来解释软件，应该比英语更有效。你只在需要提醒读者注意某些蹩脚的权宜之计时才需要注释，就像道路上只有在出现意外急弯的地方才会有箭头标识一样。</p>
