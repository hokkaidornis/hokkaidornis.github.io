<p>(00:00:00) Rome always wins because even if they lose battles, they go to the Italian allies and half citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops himself. And Hannibal, I think correctly, figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this? Hannibal’s plan is, “I’m not going to wait and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I’m going to invade Italy. I’m going to strike at the heart of this growing Roman Empire. And my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their freedom back and they’ll rebel from Rome and maybe even join me because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back, so this is a reasonable plan.”<br>(00:00:00) 罗马总能获胜，因为即便在战役中失利，他们也能向意大利盟友和半公民征召兵力，组建新的军队。那么，该如何击败罗马呢？（汉尼拔）他自己永远无法征召到如此庞大的兵力。而汉尼拔 —— 我认为他的判断是正确的 —— 找到了或许能击败罗马的唯一方法，那就是切断罗马与盟友的联系。可该怎么做呢？汉尼拔的计划是：“我不会在西班牙或北非坐等与罗马人交战，我要入侵意大利，直击这个日益壮大的罗马帝国的核心。我希望，如果我能在意大利境内打赢几场对抗罗马的大型战役，意大利人就会渴望重获自由，进而反抗罗马，甚至可能加入我这边 —— 因为大多数被征服的民族都渴望重获自由，所以这个计划是合理的。”</p>
<p>(00:00:51) Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants. Dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in Northern Italy. Romans send an army. Hannibal massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story, sends it against Hannibal. Hannibal wipes them out.<br>(00:00:51) 汉尼拔率领大象翻越阿尔卑斯山的事迹众所周知，极具戏剧性。没人预料到他会这么做，也没人认为这是可行的。（之后他）出现在意大利北部，罗马派去一支军队，却被汉尼拔击溃。他的确是军事天才。罗马花了一年时间组建第二支军队 —— 这个故事我们都有所耳闻 —— 派去对抗汉尼拔，结果又被汉尼拔全歼。</p>
<p>(00:01:12) Rome gets clever this time. They say, “Okay, Hannibal’s different. We’re going to take two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal.” They do this, and this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles in history. Hannibal is facing this army of 80, 000 Romans about, and he comes up with strategy called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it’s this famous strategy where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective, that’s more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam.<br>(00:01:12) 这一次，罗马人变得聪明了。他们认为：“好吧，汉尼拔和其他人不一样。我们要花两年时间组建两支军队，同时派去对抗他。” 他们确实这么做了，而这就引发了坎尼会战 —— 历史上最著名的战役之一。当时汉尼拔面对的是一支约 8 万人的罗马军队，他想出了一种名为 “双重包围” 的战术。当然，如果你想了解细节，我们之后可以深入探讨，但这个著名战术的核心就是：先引诱罗马军队深入，再从四面八方将其包围。在坎尼会战的那个下午，汉尼拔就歼灭了约 6 万名罗马士兵。为了让大家更直观地理解这个数字的概念：一个下午被刀剑砍杀的罗马人数量，比美国在越南战争 20 年间阵亡的人数还要多。</p>

<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:02:23) What do you think is the big difference between the ancient world and the modern world?<br>(00:02:23) 您认为古代世界和现代世界最大的区别是什么？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:02:28) Well, the easy answer, the one you often get is technology, and obviously, there’s huge differences in technology between the ancient world and today. But I think some of the more interesting stuff is a little bit more amorphous things, more structural things. I would say, first of all, childhood mortality. In the ancient world, and this is true, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, really anybody up until about the industrial Revolution, about 30 to 40% of kids died before they hit puberty.<br>(00:02:28) 嗯，最常见也最容易想到的答案是技术 —— 显然，古代与现代的技术水平存在巨大差距。但我认为，一些更有趣的区别其实是那些更模糊、更偏向结构性的层面。首先我想说的是儿童死亡率。在古代世界，无论是希腊人、罗马人、埃及人，实际上直到工业革命之前，几乎所有地区的儿童中，约有 30% 到 40% 会在青春期前夭折。</p>
<p>(00:02:57) I mean, put yourself in the place of average inhabitant of the ancient world. If you were an ancient person, three or four of your kids probably would’ve died. You would’ve buried your children. And nowadays, we think of that as an unusual thing, and just psychologically, that’s a huge thing. You would’ve seen multiple of your siblings die. If you were a woman, for example, if you were lucky enough to make it to let’s say age 13, you probably would have to give birth four or five times in order just to keep the population from dying out. Those kind of grim mortality statistics, I think, are a huge difference psychologically between the ancient world and the modern.<br>(00:02:57) 试想一下，如果你是古代的普通居民会怎样？作为古人，你的三四个孩子可能都会夭折，你不得不亲手埋葬自己的孩子。而在如今，我们会认为这种事极为罕见 —— 单从心理层面来说，这就是天壤之别。你可能会目睹多个兄弟姐妹离世；如果你是女性，就算足够幸运能活到 13 岁左右，也可能需要生育四五次，才能勉强维持人口数量不减少。我认为，这类严峻的死亡率数据，正是古代与现代在心理层面存在的巨大差异。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:03:37) But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much? Do you think the same elements of what we see today, fear, greed, love, hope, optimism and the cynicism, the underlying forces that result in war, all of that, permeates human history?<br>(00:03:37) 但从本质上来说，您认为人性发生了很大变化吗？如今我们所见的那些特质 —— 恐惧、贪婪、爱、希望、乐观与怀疑，以及引发战争的潜在驱动力 —— 您觉得这些东西是否贯穿了整个人类历史？</p>

<p>(00:03:56) Crude answer, yes. I think human nature is roughly constant. And for me, as an ancient historian, the kind of documents that I really like dealing with are not the traditional literary sources, but they’re the things that give us those little glimpse into everyday life. Stuff like tombstones or graffiti or just something that survives on a scrap of parchment that records a financial transaction. Whenever I read some of those, I’ll have this moment of feeling, ” Oh, I know exactly how that person felt.” Here across 2000 years of time, completely different cultures, I have this spark of sympathy with someone from antiquity.<br>(00:03:56) 简单来说，是的。我认为人性大致是恒定的。作为一名古代史研究者，我真正喜欢研究的文献并非传统的文学典籍，而是那些能让我们窥见古人日常生活片段的资料 —— 比如墓碑铭文、涂鸦，或是残留在羊皮纸上、记录着一笔财务交易的碎片。每当我读到这类资料时，总会有这样的瞬间：“哦，我完全能理解这个人当时的感受。” 跨越两千年的时光，身处截然不同的文化背景，我却能与古人产生一丝共鸣。</p>
<p>(00:04:40) I think, as a historian, the way you begin to understand an alien, a foreign culture, which is what these cultures are, is to look for those little moments of sympathy. But on the other hand, there’s ways in which ancient cultures are wildly different from us. You also look for those moments where you just think, “How the hell could these people have done that? I just don’t understand how they could have thought or acted in this way.” It’s lining up those moments of sympathy and kind of disconnection that I think is when you begin to start to understand a foreign culture or an ancient culture.<br>(00:04:40) 我认为，作为历史学家，要理解像古代文化这样 “陌生的”、“外来的” 文化，首先要寻找这些能产生共鸣的微小瞬间。但另一方面，古代文化在很多方面也与我们截然不同。你也会遇到这样的时刻：“这些人怎么会做出这种事？我完全无法理解他们的想法和行为。” 我觉得，正是通过梳理这些 “共鸣时刻” 与 “隔阂时刻”，我们才能真正开始理解一种外来文化或古代文化。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:05:14) I love the idea of assembling the big picture from the details and the little pieces, because that is the thing that makes up life. The big picture is nothing without the details.<br>(00:05:14) 我很认同从细微碎片中拼凑宏观图景的理念，因为生活本身就是由这些细节构成的。没有细节，宏观图景便毫无意义。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:05:23) Yep, yep, and those details would bring it to life. I mean, it’s not the grand sweep of things. It’s seeing those little hopes and fears. Another thing that I think is a huge difference between the modern world and the ancient is just basically everybody’s a farmer. Everybody’s a small family farmer, and we forget this.<br>(00:05:23) 没错，没错，正是这些细节让历史变得鲜活。我是说，重要的不是那些宏大的历史进程，而是看到古人那些微小的希望与恐惧。另外，我认为古代与现代的另一个巨大差异是：在古代，几乎所有人都是农民，都是小农家庭的一员 —— 而我们常常会忽略这一点。</p>
<p>(00:05:42) I was just writing a lecture for my next Great Courses course, and I was writing about farming in the ancient world. I was really thinking if we were to write a realistic textbook of let’s say the Roman Empire, nine out of 10 chapters should be details of what it was like to be a small-time family farmer, because that’s what 90% of the people in the ancient world did. They weren’t soldiers, they weren’t priests, they weren’t kings, they weren’t authors, they weren’t artists. They were small-town family farmers, and they lived in a little village. They never traveled 20 miles from that village. They were born there. They married somebody from there. They raised kids. They mucked around in the dirt for a couple decades and they died. They never saw a battle. They never saw a work of art. They never saw a philosopher. They never took part in any of the things we define as being history. So that’s what life should be, and that’s representative.<br>(00:05:42) 我最近正在为 “伟大课程”（Great Courses，美国知名在线课程平台）的下一门课撰写讲稿，内容涉及古代农业。我当时就在想，如果要写一本真实反映罗马帝国的教科书，那么十章里有九章都应该用来描述小农家庭的生活细节 —— 因为古代世界 90% 的人都过着这样的生活。他们不是士兵，不是祭司，不是国王，不是作家，也不是艺术家。他们是小镇上的小农，生活在一个小村庄里，一辈子都没走出过村庄 20 英里的范围：在村里出生，与同村人结婚，养育孩子，在田地里劳作几十年后离世。他们从未见过战场，从未见过艺术品，从未见过哲学家，也从未参与过任何我们定义为 “历史事件” 的事情。但这才是古代人真实的生活，也是最具代表性的生活状态。</p>

<p>(00:06:37) Nevertheless, it is the emperors and the philosophers and the artists and the warriors who carve history.<br>(00:06:37) 尽管如此，终究是皇帝、哲学家、艺术家和战士们在书写历史。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:06:43) And it is the important stuff. I mean, that’s true. There’s a reason we focus on that.<br>(00:06:43) 而且这些确实是重要的内容。我的意思是，事实就是如此，我们之所以关注这些群体，是有原因的。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:06:48) That’s a good reminder though. If we want to truly empathize and understand what life was like, we have to represent it fully.<br>(00:06:48) 但您之前的话也是个很好的提醒：如果我们想真正共情并理解古人的生活，就必须全面地展现它。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:06:56) And I would say let’s not forget them. Let’s not forget what life was like for 80, 90% of the people in the ancient world, the ones we don’t talk about, because that’s important too.<br>(00:06:56) 我想说的是，我们不要忘记他们 —— 不要忘记古代世界里那 80% 到 90%、我们很少提及的人的生活，因为那同样重要。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:07:06) The Roman Empire is widely considered to be the most powerful, influential, and impactful empire in human history. What are some reasons for that?<br>(00:07:06) 罗马帝国被广泛认为是人类历史上最强大、最具影响力且影响最深远的帝国之一。您认为其中有哪些原因？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:07:18) Yeah. I mean, Rome has been hugely influential, I think, just because of the image. I mean, there’s all these practical ways. I mean, the words I’m using to speak with you today, 30% are direct from Latin. Another 30% are from Latin descended languages. Our law codes, I mean, our habits, our holidays, everything comes fairly directly from the ancient world. But the image of Rome, at least again in Western civilization, has really been the dominant image of a successful empire. I think that’s what gives it a lot of its fascination, this idea that, “Oh, it was this great, powerful, culturally influential empire,” and there’s a lot of other empires. I mean, we could talk about ancient China, which arguably was just as big as Rome, just as culturally sophisticated, lasted about the same amount of time. But at least in Western civilization, Rome is the paradigm.<br>(00:07:18) 嗯，我认为罗马之所以影响力巨大，首先是因为它的 “形象”。当然，也有很多实际层面的原因。比如，我现在和你说话所用的词汇中，30% 直接源自拉丁语，还有 30% 来自拉丁语衍生的语言。我们的法典、生活习惯、节日 —— 几乎所有事物都在相当程度上直接传承自古代罗马。而且，至少在西方文明中，罗马的形象一直是 “成功帝国” 的主流象征。我觉得正是这种 “它曾是一个伟大、强大且具有文化影响力的帝国” 的认知，让它充满了吸引力。当然，历史上还有很多其他帝国，比如古代中国 —— 可以说它的疆域和罗马相当，文化同样精深，存续时间也差不多。但至少在西方文明里，罗马是当之无愧的典范。</p>
<p>(00:08:14) But Rome is a little schizophrenic in that it’s both the empire when it was ruled by emperors, which is one kind of model, and it’s the Roman Republic when it was a pseudo-democracy, which is a different model. It’s interesting how some later civilizations tend to either focus on one or the other of those. The United States, Revolutionary France, they were very obsessed with the Roman Republic as a model. But other people, Mussolini, Hitler, Napoleon, they were very obsessed with the Empire. Victorian Britain as a model.<br>(00:08:14) 不过罗马的形象有点 “分裂”：它既是由皇帝统治的 “帝国”（一种模式），也曾是实行伪民主制度的 “罗马共和国”（另一种模式）。有趣的是，后世一些文明往往只侧重其中一种模式。比如美国和法国大革命时期的法国，就非常痴迷于以罗马共和国为范本；而墨索里尼、希特勒、拿破仑等人，则更痴迷于罗马帝国的模式，维多利亚时代的英国也同样如此。</p>
<p>(00:08:48) Rome itself has different aspects. But what I think is actually another big difference between the modern world and the ancient is our relationship with the past. One of the keys to understanding all of Roman history is to understand that this was a people who were obsessed with the past and for whom the past had power, not just as something inspirational, but it actually dictated what you would do in your daily life. Today, especially in the United States, we don’t have much of a relationship with the past. We see ourselves as free agents just floating along, not tethered to what came before.<br>(00:08:48) 罗马本身具有多面性，但我认为古代与现代的另一个重要差异，在于我们与 “历史” 的关系。理解整个罗马历史的关键之一，就是要明白：罗马人极度痴迷于历史，历史对他们而言不仅具有启发意义，更拥有实际的 “力量”—— 它甚至能决定人们在日常生活中的行为。而如今，尤其是在美国，我们与历史的关联并不紧密。我们倾向于将自己视为 “自由个体”，仿佛可以不受过去的束缚，随意前行。</p>
<p>(00:09:28) The classical story that I sometimes tell in my classes to illustrate this is Rome started out as a monarchy. They had kings. They were kind of unhappy with their kings. Around 500 BC, they held a revolution and they kicked out the kings, and one of the guys who played a key role in this was a man named Lucius Junius Brutus. 500 years later, 500 years down the road, a guy comes along, Julius Caesar, who starts to act like a king. If you have trouble with kings in Roman society, who are you going to call? Somebody named Brutus. Now as it happens, there is a guy named Brutus in Roman society at this time, who is one of Julius Caesar’s best friends, Marcus Junius Brutus. Now, before I go further with the story, and I think you probably know where it ends, I talk about how important your ancestors are in Roman culture. I mean, if you went to an aristocratic Roman’s house and opened the front door and walked in, the first thing you would see would be a big wooden cabinet. If you open that up, what you would see would be row after row of wax death masks. When a Roman aristocrat died, they literally put hot wax on his face and made an impression of his face at that moment. They hung these in a big cabinet right inside the front door. Every time you entered your house, you were literally staring at the faces of your ancestors.<br>(00:09:28) 我在课堂上常讲一个经典故事来阐释这一点：罗马最初是君主制国家，有国王统治，但民众对国王并不满意。大约在公元前 500 年，罗马人发动革命推翻了君主制，其中起关键作用的人之一名叫卢修斯・尤尼乌斯・布鲁图。500 年后，尤利乌斯・凯撒出现了，他的行事作风开始像个国王。在罗马社会，若有人对 “国王” 不满，你会想到谁？自然是名叫 “布鲁图” 的人。巧的是，当时罗马社会恰好有个叫布鲁图的人 —— 马库斯・尤尼乌斯・布鲁图，他还是凯撒最好的朋友之一。在继续讲这个故事之前（我想你大概知道结局），我得先说说祖先在罗马文化中的重要性。比如，如果你走进一个罗马贵族的家，推开门第一眼看到的会是一个巨大的木柜。打开柜子，里面整齐排列着一排排蜡质遗容面具。每当一位罗马贵族去世，人们会用热蜡拓下他当时的面部轮廓，制成面具，然后将这些面具挂在正门内侧的木柜里。也就是说，每次你走进家门，都相当于直面祖先的面容。</p>
<p>(00:10:53) Every child in that family would have obsessively memorized every accomplishment of every one of those ancestors. He would’ve known their career, what offices they held, what battles they fought in, what they did. When somebody new in the family died, there would be a big funeral and they would talk about all the things their ancestors had did. The kids in the family would literally take out those masks, tie them onto their own faces, and wear them in the funeral procession. You were wearing the face of your ancestors. So you as an individual weren’t important, you were just the latest iteration of that family, and there was enormous weight, huge weight to live up to the deeds of your ancestors. The Romans were absolutely obsessed with the past, especially with your own family. Every Roman kid who is let’s say an aristocratic family could tell you every one of his ancestors back centuries. I can’t go beyond my grandparents, I don’t even know, but that’s maybe 100 years. It’s a completely different attitude towards the past.<br>(00:10:53) 这个家族的每个孩子都会执着地记住每位祖先的所有功绩 —— 他们的职业生涯、担任过的官职、参加过的战役、所做过的大事。每当家族中有新成员去世，人们会举办盛大的葬礼，在葬礼上讲述所有祖先的事迹。家族里的孩子会取出那些遗容面具，系在自己脸上，戴着它们参加送葬队伍。你相当于 “顶着” 祖先的面容前行。因此，作为个体的你并不重要，你只是这个家族的 “最新一代传承者”，而 “不辜负祖先功绩” 的压力是巨大的，大到难以想象。罗马人对历史的痴迷是真切的，尤其是对自家家族史。比如，一个罗马贵族家庭的孩子，能说出几百年前每一位祖先的名字和事迹。而我连自己曾祖父母的事迹都记不全，顶多只能追溯到祖父母那一代，也就大约 100 年的时间。可见，我们与罗马人对历史的态度截然不同。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:11:52) And the level of celebration that we have now of the ancestors, even the ones we can name, is not as intense as it was in Roman times.<br>(00:11:52) 而且现在我们对祖先的纪念 —— 即便对那些我们能叫出名字的祖先 —— 其重视程度也远不及罗马时代。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:11:59) No, no. I mean, it was obsessive and oppressive. It determined what you did.<br>(00:11:59) 确实远不及。罗马人对祖先的重视不仅是 “痴迷”，甚至带有 “压迫性”—— 它能决定你该做什么。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:12:00) Oppressive, oh.<br>(00:12:00) 压迫性？哦，这有点出人意料。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:12:05) Yes. Because there’s that weight for you to act like your ancestors did.<br>(00:12:05) 是的。因为你背负着 “要像祖先那样行事” 的沉重压力。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:12:08) Not to speak sort of philosophically, but do you think it was limiting to the way that society develops to be deeply constrained by the-<br>(00:12:08) 我不想说得太哲学化，但您觉得，被（历史）深深束缚，会不会限制社会的发展方式 ——</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:12:18) Yes. Absolutely.<br>(00:12:18) 会的，毫无疑问会。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:12:18) Limiting in a good way or a bad way, you think?<br>(00:12:18) 那您觉得这种限制是好是坏呢？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:12:21) Well, like everything, it’s a little of both. But the bad, on the one hand, it gives them enormous strength and it gives them this enormous connection. It gives them guidance. But the negative is what’s interesting, is it makes the Romans extremely traditional minded and extremely conservative, and I mean conservative in the sense of resistant to change.<br>(00:12:21) 嗯，就像所有事情一样，它既有好的一面，也有坏的一面。好的方面是，这种对历史的尊崇给了罗马人巨大的力量，让他们拥有强烈的群体归属感，也为他们的行为提供了指引。但有趣的是它的负面影响：它让罗马人思想极度传统、极度保守 —— 这里的 “保守” 指的是 “抗拒变革”。</p>
<p>(00:12:40) In the late Republic, which we’ll probably talk about later, Rome desperately needed to change certain things, but it was a society that did things the way the ancestors did it, and they didn’t make some obvious changes, which might have saved their Republic. That’s the downside is that it locks you into something and you can’t change.<br>(00:12:40) 比如在共和国晚期（我们之后可能会谈到这个时期），罗马迫切需要在某些方面进行改革，但这个社会坚持 “按祖先的方式行事”，不愿做出一些显而易见的改变 —— 而那些改变或许本可以挽救共和制度。这就是负面影响：它会把你困在既定模式里，让你无法变革。</p>
<p>(00:12:58) But to get us back to the Brutus’s, 500 years after that first Brutus got rid of kings, Julius Caesar starts to act like a king, one of his best friends is Marcus Junius Brutus. And literally, in the middle of the night, people go to Brutus’s house and write graffiti on it that says, “Remember your ancestor?” And another one is, I think, “You’re no real Brutus.” And at that point, he really has no choice. He forms a conspiracy. On the Ides of March 44 BC, he and 23 other senators take daggers, stick them in Julius Caesar, and kill him for acting like a king. The way I always pose this to my students is, “How many of you would stick a knife in your best friend because of what your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather did?”<br>(00:12:58) 我们回到布鲁图的故事。第一位布鲁图推翻君主制 500 年后，尤利乌斯・凯撒的行事开始像个国王，而他最好的朋友之一就是马库斯・尤尼乌斯・布鲁图。后来，真的有人在半夜跑到布鲁图家墙上涂鸦，写着 “还记得你的祖先吗？”，还有一句我记得是 “你根本不配叫布鲁图”。到了这个时候，布鲁图其实已经别无选择了。他组织了一场阴谋，在公元前 44 年的 3 月 15 日（“ides of March”，罗马历法中 3 月、5 月等月份的 15 日），他和另外 23 位元老院议员手持匕首，刺杀了行事如国王的凯撒。我经常这样问我的学生：“你们当中有多少人会因为自己几十代前的祖先做过的事，而拿刀刺向最好的朋友？”</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:13:48) That’s commitment.<br>(00:13:48) 这真是一种极致的 “坚守”。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:13:50) That’s the power of the past. That’s a society where the past isn’t just influential, but it dictates what you do. And that concept, I think, is very alien to us today. We can’t imagine murdering our best friend because of what some incredibly distant ancestor did 500 years ago. But to Brutus, there is no choice. You have to do that.<br>(00:13:50) 这就是历史的力量。在那样的社会里，历史不仅具有影响力，更能 “命令” 你该做什么。我觉得这种观念对现在的我们来说非常陌生 —— 我们无法想象，会因为 500 年前某个远得不能再远的祖先做过的事，就去杀害最好的朋友。但对布鲁图来说，他没有选择，必须这么做。</p>
<p>(00:14:11) A lot of societies have this power of the past. Today, not so much, but some still do. About a decade ago, I was in Serbia and I was talking to some of the people there about the breakup of Yugoslavia and some of the wars that had taken place where people turned against their neighbors, basically murdered people they had lived next to for decades. When I was talking to them, some of them actually brought up things like, “Oh, well, it was justified because in this battle in 12 whatever, they did this.” And I was thinking, “Wow, you’re citing something from 800 years ago to justify your actions today.” That’s a modern person who still understands the power of the past, or maybe is crippled by it, is another way to view it.<br>(00:14:11) 很多社会都曾受历史的这种 “力量” 影响。如今这种情况已不多见，但仍有部分社会如此。大约十年前，我在塞尔维亚时，曾和当地一些人聊起南斯拉夫解体以及随之爆发的战争 —— 在那些战争中，人们反目成仇，甚至杀害了与自己相邻数十年的邻居。交谈中，有些人竟然提到：“哦，这是合理的，因为在 12 世纪某次战役中，他们就这么做过。” 我当时就想：“天啊，你竟然用 800 年前的事来为现在的行为辩护。” 从这个角度看，这些现代人或许仍认可历史的力量，也可能是被历史的力量所束缚。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:14:55) This is an interesting point and an interesting perspective to remember about the way the Romans thought, especially in the context of how power is transferred, whether it’s hereditary or not, which changes throughout Roman history. It’s interesting. It’s interesting to remember that, the value of the ancestors<br>(00:14:55) 这一点很有意思，也为我们理解罗马人的思维方式提供了独特视角 —— 尤其是结合罗马历史中权力传承方式的演变（无论是世袭还是非世袭）来看，更是如此。确实值得关注，尤其是祖先的价值这一点。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:15:13) Yep, and just the weight of tradition.<br>(00:15:13) 没错，还有传统带来的沉重压力。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:15:15) The weight of tradition.<br>(00:15:15) 传统的压力。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:15:16) For the Romans, the mos maiorum is this Latin term, which means the way the ancestors did it, and it’s kind of their word for tradition. For them, tradition is what your forefathers and mothers did, and you have to follow that example, and you have to live up to that.<br>(00:15:16) 对罗马人来说，“mos maiorum”（拉丁语，直译为 “祖先的习俗”）就是他们对 “传统” 的称呼。在他们眼中，传统就是先辈们的所作所为，而你必须效仿先辈，不辜负他们的典范。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:15:31) Does that mean that class mobility was difficult? If your ancestors were farmers, there was a major constraint on remaining a farmer, essentially.<br>(00:15:31) 那这是不是意味着社会阶层流动很困难？比如，如果你的祖先是农民，那你本质上也很可能被束缚在农民的身份上？</p>
<h2 id="Three-phases-of-Roman-history"><a href="#Three-phases-of-Roman-history" class="headerlink" title="Three phases of Roman history"></a>Three phases of Roman history</h2><h2 id="罗马历史的三个阶段"><a href="#罗马历史的三个阶段" class="headerlink" title="罗马历史的三个阶段"></a>罗马历史的三个阶段</h2><p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:15:40) I mean, the Romans all like to think of themselves as farmers, even filthy rich Romans. It was just their national identity is the citizen soldier farmer thing. But it did, among the aristocrats, the people who kind of ran things, yeah, it was hard to break into that if you didn’t have famous ancestors. It was such a big deal that there was a specific term called a novus homo, a new man, for someone who was the first person in their family to get elected to a major office in the Roman government because that was a weird and different and new thing. You actually designated them by this special term. Yeah, you’re absolutely right.<br>(00:15:40) 其实，所有罗马人都喜欢把自己视为农民，哪怕是腰缠万贯的罗马人也不例外 ——“公民 - 士兵 - 农民” 本就是他们的国家身份认同。但确实，对于贵族阶层（也就是掌控权力的人）来说，如果你没有显赫的祖先，几乎不可能跻身其中。这种情况非常普遍，以至于罗马人专门创造了一个术语 “novus homo”（拉丁语，意为 “新人”），用来指代家族中首位当选罗马政府重要官职的人 —— 因为这种事在当时既罕见又特殊，所以需要用专门的词汇来界定。所以你说得完全正确。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:16:19) If we may, let us zoom out, it would help me, maybe it’ll help the audience to look at the different periods that we’ve been talking about. You mentioned the Republic. You mentioned maybe when it took a form of empire and maybe there was the age of kings. What are the different periods of this Roman, let’s call it, what? The big-<br>(00:16:19) 如果可以的话，我们不妨把视角拉远一些 —— 这样不仅能帮我理清思路，或许也能让听众更好地理解我们之前讨论过的不同时期。您提到了共和国，提到了帝国时期，还提到了君主制时代。罗马历史的不同阶段，我们该如何划分这些主要的 ——</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:16:37) Roman history.<br>(00:16:37) 罗马历史阶段。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:16:38) Roman history. And a lot of people just call that whole period Roman Empire loosely, right?<br>(00:16:38) 对，罗马历史阶段。而且很多人会笼统地把整个时期都称为 “罗马帝国”，是吧？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:16:44) Yeah.<br>(00:16:44) 是的。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:16:44) Maybe can you speak to the different periods?<br>(00:16:44) 那您能具体讲讲这些不同阶段吗？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:16:45) Yes, absolutely. Conventionally, Roman history is divided into three chronological periods. The first of those is from 773 BC to 509 BC, which is called the monarchy. All the periods get their names from the form of government. This is the earliest phase of Roman history. It’s when Rome is mostly just a fairly undistinguished little collection of mud huts, honestly, just like dozens of other cities of little mud huts in Italy. That early phase, about 750 to around 500 BC is the monarchy. They’re ruled by kings.<br>(00:16:45) 当然可以。按照传统划分，罗马历史依据时间顺序分为三个阶段。第一个阶段是公元前 773 年至公元前 509 年，称为 “君主制时期”—— 所有阶段的名称都源于当时的政府形式。这是罗马历史最早的阶段，说实话，那时的罗马还只是一个不起眼的小村落，全是泥屋，和意大利境内几十个类似的泥屋村落没什么区别。这个早期阶段（大致公元前 750 年至公元前 500 年）由国王统治，即君主制时期。</p>
<p>(00:17:20) Then there’s this revolution, they kick out the kings, they become a Republic. That lasts from 500 BC roughly to about either 31 or 27 BC, depending what date you pick as most important, but about 500 years. The Republic is when they have a Republican form of government. Some people idealize this as Rome’s greatest period, and the big thing in that period is Rome first expands to conquer all of Italy in the first 250 years of that 500 year stretch. And then, the second 250 years, they conquer all the Mediterranean basin roughly. This is this time of enormous successful Roman conquest and expansion.<br>(00:17:20) 之后发生了一场革命，罗马人推翻了国王，建立了共和国。共和国时期大致从公元前 500 年持续到公元前 31 年或公元前 27 年（具体年份取决于以哪个关键事件为划分节点），时长约 500 年。这一阶段罗马实行共和制政府，有些人将其视为罗马最辉煌的时期。共和国时期的重要特征是罗马的大规模扩张：在前 250 年里，罗马征服了整个意大利；在后 250 年里，又大致征服了整个地中海盆地。这是罗马征服与扩张取得巨大成功的时代。</p>
<p>(00:17:59) And then, you have another switch up and they become ruled by emperors. Back to the idea of one guy in charge, though the Romans try to pretend it’s not like a king, it’s something else. Anyway, we can get into that. But they’re very touchy about kings, so they have emperors. Roman Empire, the first emperor is Augustus. Starts off as Octavian, switches his name to Augustus when he becomes emperor. He kind of sets the model for what happens.<br>(00:17:59) 之后，罗马的政治体制再次转变，进入由皇帝统治的时期。虽然又回到了 “一人掌权” 的模式，但罗马人刻意避免使用 “国王” 的称呼，而是称之为 “皇帝”—— 他们对 “国王” 这个词非常敏感，这点我们之后可以深入讨论。罗马帝国的首位皇帝是奥古斯都（Augustus），他最初名叫屋大维（Octavian），登基后才改名为奥古斯都，他也为后续的帝国统治奠定了模式。</p>
<h2 id="Rome’s-expansion"><a href="#Rome’s-expansion" class="headerlink" title="Rome’s expansion"></a>Rome’s expansion</h2><h2 id="罗马的扩张"><a href="#罗马的扩张" class="headerlink" title="罗马的扩张"></a>罗马的扩张</h2><p>(00:18:26) And then, how long does the Roman Empire last? That’s one of those great questions. The conventional answer is usually sometime in the fifth century, so the 400s AD, so about another 500 years, let’s say. So nice kind of even division, 500 years of Republic, 500 years of empire. But you can make very good cases for lots of other dates for the end of the Roman Empire. I actually think it goes all the way through the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, so another 1500 years, but that’s a whole other discussion. But so that’s your three phases of Roman history,<br>(00:18:26) 那么罗马帝国持续了多久呢？这是一个颇具争议的问题。传统答案通常认为是公元 5 世纪（即公元 400 年代），也就是说帝国时期约持续了 500 年 —— 这样算下来，共和国和帝国各占 500 年，划分得相当规整。但关于罗马帝国的终结年份，还有很多合理的不同说法。我个人认为，罗马帝国的历史应延续到 1453 年拜占庭帝国灭亡，这样算下来又多了 1500 年，但这就是另一个需要深入探讨的话题了。总之，以上就是罗马历史的三个主要阶段。</p>

<p>(00:18:59) And in some fundamental way, it still persists today, given how much of its ideas define our modern life, especially in the western world.<br>(00:18:59) 而且从某种根本意义上来说，罗马的影响至今仍在 —— 它的诸多理念塑造了我们的现代生活，尤其是在西方世界。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:19:08) Yeah.<br>(00:19:08) 没错。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼</p>
<p>(00:19:09) Can you speak to the relationship between ancient Greece and Roman Empire, both in the chronological sense and in the influence sense?<br>(00:19:09) 您能从时间顺序和文化影响两个方面，讲讲古希腊和罗马帝国的关系吗？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>格雷戈里・奥尔德雷特</p>
<p>(00:19:19) Well, I mean, ancient Greece comes… The classical era of Greek civilization is around the 500s BC. That’s when you have the great achievements of Athens. It becomes the first sort of true democracy. They defeat the Persian invasions. A lot of famous stuff happens in the 400s, let’s say. So that is contemporaneous with Rome, but the Greek civilization, in a sense, is peaking earlier. And one of the things that happens is that Greece ends up being conquered by Rome in that second half of the Roman Republic between 250 and about 30 BC. And so, Greece falls under the control of Rome and Rome is very heavily influenced by Greek culture. They themselves see the Greeks as a superior civilization, culturally more sophisticated, great art, great philosophy, all this. Another thing about the Romans is they’re super competitive. One of the engines that drives Romans is this public competitiveness, especially among the upper classes. They care more about their status and standing among their peers than they do about money or even their own life, so there’s this intense competition.<br>(00:19:19) 好的。古希腊文明的 “古典时代” 大约在公元前 500 年左右，这一时期雅典取得了辉煌成就，成为首个真正意义上的民主政体，还击败了波斯人的入侵。公元前 400 年前后，古希腊也发生了很多著名事件。从时间上看，古希腊与罗马是同期存在的，但古希腊文明的鼎盛时期更早。而在罗马共和国后半段（公元前 250 年至公元前 30 年左右），希腊被罗马征服，归入罗马统治之下 —— 此后，罗马深受希腊文化的影响。罗马人自己也认为希腊是更优越的文明，在文化上更精深，拥有伟大的艺术、哲学等成就。此外，罗马人极具竞争性，这种公开的竞争精神（尤其是在上层阶层中）是推动他们行动的核心动力之一。他们对自身在同辈中的地位和声望的重视，甚至超过了对金钱乃至生命的重视，竞争氛围非常激烈。</p>
<p>(00:20:36) When they conquer Greece, Greek culture just becomes one more arena of competition. Romans will start to learn Greek. They’ll start to memorize Homer. They’ll start to see who can quote more passages of Homer in Greek in their letters to one another because that increases their status. Rome absorbs Greek civilization, and then the two get fused together.<br>(00:20:36) 征服希腊后，希腊文化成了罗马人新的 “竞争领域”：罗马人开始学习希腊语，背诵荷马的史诗，甚至会在书信中比拼谁能引用更多希腊语的荷马诗句 —— 因为这能提升他们的社会地位。就这样，罗马吸收了希腊文明，两者逐渐融合。</p>
<p>(00:20:59) The other thing I should mention in terms of influences that’s really huge on Rome is the Etruscans, and this is one that comes along before the Greeks. The Etruscans were this kind of mysterious culture that flourished in northern Italy before the Romans, so way back 800 BC. They were much more powerful than the Romans. They were a loose confederation of states. For awhile, the Romans even seemed to have been under Etruscan control. The last of the Roman kings was really an Etruscan guy pretty clearly. But the Etruscans end up giving to Rome, or you could say Rome ends up stealing perhaps, a lot of elements of Etruscan culture. Many of the things that we today think of as distinctively Roman, our cliches of what a Roman is, actually aren’t truly Roman, they’re stuff they stole from the Etruscans. Just a couple examples, the toga. What do you think of a Roman? It’s a guy wearing a toga, and the toga is the mark of a Roman citizen. Well, that’s what Etruscan kings wore, probably.<br>(00:20:59) 另外，除了希腊，还有一个对罗马影响巨大的文明 —— 伊特鲁里亚文明（Etruscans），而且它对罗马的影响比希腊更早。伊特鲁里亚人是一个略带神秘色彩的文明，早在公元前 800 年就活跃于意大利北部，比罗马兴盛得更早，实力也远超早期罗马。他们是一个松散的城邦联盟，罗马甚至曾一度处于伊特鲁里亚人的统治之下，罗马最后几位国王显然就是伊特鲁里亚人。伊特鲁里亚文明为罗马贡献了（或者说罗马从伊特鲁里亚 “借鉴” 了）大量文化元素。如今我们认为极具 “罗马特色” 的很多事物，其实并非罗马原创，而是源自伊特鲁里亚。举几个例子：托加袍（toga）—— 提到罗马人，我们脑海里总会浮现出穿托加袍的形象，托加袍也是罗马公民的标志，但这种服饰很可能最初是伊特鲁里亚国王的穿着。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:22:33) I mean, that’s a really powerful thing. It’s a powerful aspect of a civilization to be able to, we can call it stealing which is a negative connotation, but you can also see its integration basically. Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer or the peoples that you interact with.<br>(00:22:33) 我想说，这其实是一种非常强大的能力。一个文明能做到这一点 —— 我们可以用带有负面意味的 “窃取” 来形容，但本质上这其实是 “融合”—— 真的很了不起。没错，就是从被征服的族群或接触到的族群中，吸纳那些最优秀的东西。</p>
<p>(00:22:53) Not every empire does that. There’s a lot of nations and empires that when they conquer, they annihilate versus integrate. And so, it’s an interesting thing to be able to culturally… The form that the competitiveness takes is that you want to compete in the realm of ideas in culture versus compete strictly in the realm of military conquest.<br>(00:22:53) 并非所有帝国都能做到这一点。很多国家和帝国在征服后，会选择毁灭而非融合。所以，能在文化层面做到这一点很有意思…… 这种竞争方式不再局限于军事征服，而是延伸到了思想和文化领域。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:23:19) Yeah, and I think you’ve exactly put your finger on one of the, let’s say, secrets of Rome’s success, which is that they’re very good at integrating non-Romans or non-Roman ideas and kind of absorbing them.<br>(00:23:19) 没错，我觉得你精准地指出了罗马成功的一个关键 —— 他们非常擅长整合非罗马人或非罗马理念，并将其吸收内化。</p>
<p>(00:23:34) One of the things that’s absolutely crucial early in Roman history, when they’re just one of these tiny little mud hut villages fighting dozens of other mud hut villages in Italy, why does Rome emerge as the dominant one? Well, one of the things they do is when they do finally succeed in conquering somebody else, let’s say another Italianate people, they do something very unusual because the normal procedure in the ancient world is let’s say you conquer another city, you often kill most of the men, enslave the women and children, steal all the stuff, right? The Romans, at least with the Italians, conquer the other city, and sometimes they’ll do that, but sometimes they’ll also then say, “All right, we’re going to now leave you alone and we’re going to share with you a degree of Roman citizenship.” Sometimes they’d make them full citizens, more often they’d make them something we call half citizens, which is kind of what sounds like you get some of the privileges of citizenship, but not all of them. Sometimes they would just make them allies, but they would sort of incorporate them into the Roman project.<br>(00:23:34) 在罗马历史早期，当它还只是意大利众多泥屋村落中的一个、需要和几十个同类村落争斗时，有一件事至关重要：罗马为何能脱颖而出成为霸主？其中一个原因是，当他们最终征服某个族群（比如另一个意大利族群）时，会采取一种不同寻常的做法。要知道，古代世界的常规操作是：征服一座城市后，通常会杀死大部分男性，将妇女和儿童变为奴隶，再洗劫所有财物，对吧？但罗马人（至少对意大利族群）并非总是如此 —— 有时他们会说：“好，我们不会过多干涉你们，还会授予你们一定程度的罗马公民权。” 有时会给予完整公民权，但更常见的是 “半公民权”—— 顾名思义，就是能享受部分公民特权，但并非全部。有时他们会将被征服者吸纳为盟友，让其融入 “罗马事业” 之中。</p>
<p>(00:24:33) They wouldn’t necessarily ask for money or taxes, which is weird too. But instead, the one thing they would always, always demand from the conquered cities in Italy is that they provide troops to the Roman army. The army becomes this mechanism of Romanization where you pull in foreigners, you make them like you, and then they end up fighting for you. Early on, the secret to Rome’s military success is not that they have better generals. It’s not that they have better equipment. It’s not that they have better strategy or tactics. It’s that they have limitless manpower, relatively speaking. They lose a war and they just come back and fight again, and they lose again, and they come back and they fight again, and eventually they just wear down their enemies because their key thing of their policy is we incorporate the conquered people.<br>(00:24:33) 而且他们未必会索要钱财或赋税，这点也很特别。但有一点是罗马对意大利境内被征服城市的硬性要求 —— 必须为罗马军队提供兵力。军队由此成为 “罗马化” 的工具：吸纳外族人，让他们逐渐认同罗马，最终为罗马而战。在早期，罗马军事成功的秘诀并非拥有更优秀的将领、更精良的装备，也不是更出色的战略战术，而是相对而言 “取之不尽的人力”。他们输掉一场战争，会卷土重来；再输一场，依然会重新集结 —— 最终靠这种韧性拖垮敌人。而这一切的核心政策，就是 “融合被征服者”。</p>
<p>(00:25:25) The great moment that just exemplifies this is pretty late in this process. They’ve been doing this for 250 years just about, and they’ve gotten down to the toe of Italy, they’re conquering the very last cities down there. One of the last cities is actually a Greek city. It’s a Greek colony. It’s a wealthy city, and so when the Romans show up on the doorstep and are about to attack them, they do what any rich Greek colony or city does, they go out and hire the best mercenaries they can. They hire this guy who thinks of himself as the new Alexander the Great, a man named Pyrrhus of Epirus. He’s a mercenary. He is actually related to Alexander distantly. He has a terrific army, top-notch army. He’s got elephants. He’s got all the latest military technology. The Romans come and fight a battle against him, and Pyrrhus knows what he’s doing. He wipes out the Romans.<br>(00:25:25) 最能体现这一点的经典案例，发生在这个扩张过程的后期。当时罗马已经用这种策略经营了约 250 年，一路打到意大利最南端，正征服那里最后几座城市。其中一座是希腊殖民地，相当富有。当罗马大军兵临城下时，这座城市像所有富裕的希腊殖民地一样，重金招募了最精锐的雇佣兵 —— 这个人自视 “新亚历山大大帝”，名叫伊庇鲁斯的皮洛士（Pyrrhus of Epirus）。他是一名雇佣兵，与亚历山大大帝有远亲关系，手下有一支精锐之师，配备了大象和当时最先进的军事装备。罗马出兵与之交战，皮洛士战术娴熟，击溃了罗马军队。</p>
<p>(00:26:12) He thinks, “Okay, now we’ll have a peace treaty. We’ll negotiate something. I can go home.” But the Romans won’t even talk. They go to their Italian allies and half-citizens, they raise a second army, they send it against Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus says, ‘Okay, these guys are slow learners. Fine.” He fights them again, wipes them out, thinks, “Now we’ll have a peace treaty.” But the Romans go back to the allies, raise a third army and send it after Pyrrhus. When he sees that third army coming, he says, “I can’t afford to win another battle. I win these battles, but each time I lose some of my troops and I can’t replace them, and the Romans just keep sprouting new armies.” So he gives up and goes home.<br>(00:26:12) 皮洛士心想：“好了，现在该签订和平协议了，协商一下条件，我就能撤军回国了。” 但罗马人根本不愿谈判。他们转而向意大利盟友和半公民征召兵力，组建了第二支军队，再次迎战皮洛士。皮洛士说：“好吧，这些人真是不撞南墙不回头。” 他再次击败罗马军队，又以为 “这次该谈和了”。可罗马人又去征召盟友，组建了第三支军队。当皮洛士看到这支新军队逼近时，他意识到：“我再也承受不起‘胜利’的代价了。虽然每场仗我都赢了，但每次都会损失兵力，且无法补充；而罗马人总能不断组建新的军队。” 于是他放弃作战，撤军回国。</p>
<p>(00:26:55) Rome kind of loses every battle, but wins the war. Pyrrhus one of, actually, his officers has a great line as they’re going back to Greece. He says, “Fighting the Romans is like fighting a hydra,” and a hydra is this mythological monster that when you cut off one head, two more grow in its place, so you can just never win.<br>(00:26:55) 罗马虽然输掉了每一场战役，却赢得了整场战争。皮洛士的一名军官在撤军返回希腊时说过一句名言：“与罗马人作战，就像与九头蛇作战。” 九头蛇是神话中的怪兽，砍掉一个头，就会再长出两个 —— 你永远无法真正战胜它。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:27:17) That’s fascinating.<br>(00:27:17) 这太有意思了。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:27:18) So that’s the secret to Rome’s early success.<br>(00:27:18) 这就是罗马早期成功的秘诀。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:27:21) It’s not the military strategy. It’s not some technological asymmetry of power. It’s literally just manpower.<br>(00:27:21) 不是靠军事战略，也不是靠某种技术层面的实力优势，本质上就是靠人力。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:27:28) Mm-hm. Early on.<br>(00:27:28) 嗯，早期确实是这样。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:27:28) Early on.<br>(00:27:28) 早期是这样。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:27:30) And later, the Romans get very good… We’re into the empire phase now. Once they have emperors into the AD era of kind of doing the same thing by drawing in the best and the brightest and the most ambitious and the most talented local leaders of the people they conquer. When they go someplace, let’s say they conquer tribe of what to them as barbarians, they’ll often take the sons of the barbarian chiefs, bring them to Rome and raise them as Romans.<br>(00:27:30) 到了后来 —— 也就是帝国时期，罗马人在这方面做得更出色了。公元后的帝国时代，他们延续了类似策略，不过是吸纳被征服族群中最优秀、最有智慧、最有野心且最具才能的地方领袖。比如，当他们征服某个在他们看来是 “蛮族” 的部落时，常会把蛮族首领的儿子带到罗马，按照罗马人的方式抚养。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:28:02) Damn.<br>(00:28:02) 天呐。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:28:02) And so, it’s that whole way of turning your enemies into your own strength. The Romans start giving citizenship to areas they conquer. Once they move out of Italy, they aren’t as free with the citizenship, but eventually they do. They make Spain, lots of cities in Spain, they make all citizens and other places. And soon enough, the Roman emperors and the Roman senators are not Italians, they’re coming from Spain or North Africa or Germany or wherever.<br>(00:28:02) 这就是把敌人转化为自身力量的策略。罗马人开始向被征服地区授予公民权 —— 虽然走出意大利后，他们在公民权授予上不再像之前那样宽松，但最终还是推行了。比如在西班牙，很多城市的居民都获得了完整公民权。没过多久，罗马皇帝和元老院议员中就出现了非意大利人，他们来自西班牙、北非、德国等地。</p>
<p>(00:28:32) As early as the second century AD of the Roman Empire, so the first set of emperors, the first 100 years were all Italians, but right away at the beginning of the second century AD you have Trajan, who’s from Spain. The next guy, Hadrian’s from Spain, and then a century later, you have Septimius Severus, who’s from North Africa. You would later get guys from Syria. I mean, the actual leaders of the Roman Empire are coming from the provinces.<br>(00:28:32) 早在罗马帝国的 2 世纪（公元后），情况就已经如此了：帝国最初 100 年的皇帝都是意大利人，但到了 2 世纪初，图拉真（Trajan）成为首位西班牙出身的皇帝；他之后的哈德良（Hadrian）也来自西班牙；一个世纪后，又出现了北非出身的塞普蒂米乌斯・塞维鲁（Septimius Severus）；后来还有叙利亚出身的皇帝。也就是说，罗马帝国的实际统治者已经来自各个行省了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:28:56) That’s brilliant.<br>(00:28:56) 这太精妙了。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:28:57) And it’s that openness to incorporating foreigners, making them work for you, making them want to be part of your empire, that I think is one of Rome’s strengths.<br>(00:28:57) 我认为，这种愿意接纳外族人、让他们为罗马效力、让他们主动渴望成为帝国一员的开放性，正是罗马的优势之一。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:29:07) Taking the sons is a brilliant idea and bringing them to Rome, because a kind of generational integration.<br>(00:29:07) 把首领的儿子带到罗马抚养，这真是个高招，相当于实现了代际层面的融合。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:29:15) The Roman military, later in the empire, is this giant machine of half a million people that takes in foreigners and churns out Romans. The army is composed of two groups. You have the Roman Legionaries who are all citizens, but then you have another group that’s just as large, about 250,000 of each, 250,000 Legionaries, 250,000 of the second group called Auxiliaries. Auxiliaries tend to be newly conquered warlike people that the Romans enlist as Auxiliaries to fight with them. They serve side by side with the Roman legions for 25 years. At the end of that time, when they’re discharged, what do they get? They get Roman citizenship, and their kids then tend to become Roman Legionaries.<br>(00:29:15) 到了帝国后期，罗马军队已经成为一台拥有 50 万人的庞大机器 —— 吸纳外族人，将他们培养成罗马人。军队分为两部分：一是 “罗马军团士兵”（Legionaries），全部由公民担任；二是规模相当的 “辅助部队”（Auxiliaries），两者各约 25 万人。辅助部队成员通常是新征服地区的好战族群，罗马招募他们并肩作战。他们要和罗马军团一起服役 25 年，退役时能获得什么？罗马公民权。而他们的后代，往往会成为新的罗马军团士兵。</p>
<h2 id="Punic-wars"><a href="#Punic-wars" class="headerlink" title="Punic wars"></a>Punic wars</h2><h2 id="布匿战争"><a href="#布匿战争" class="headerlink" title="布匿战争"></a>布匿战争</h2><p>(00:30:04) Again, you’re taking the most warlike and potentially dangerous of your enemies, kind of absorbing them, putting through this thing for 25 years where they learn Latin, they learn Roman customs, they maybe marry someone who’s already a Roman or a Latin woman. They have kids within the system, their kids become Roman Legionaries, and you’ve thoroughly integrated what could have been your biggest enemies, right? Your greatest threat.<br>(00:30:04) 你看，罗马就是这样：把敌人中最尚武、最具潜在威胁的群体吸纳进来，让他们在 25 年的服役期里学习拉丁语、熟悉罗马习俗，或许还会与罗马人或拉丁人通婚。他们在这个体系内成家生子，后代再成为罗马军团士兵 —— 就这样，原本可能成为最大威胁的群体，被彻底融入了罗马。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:30:28) That’s just brilliant, brilliant process of integration. Is that what explains the rapid expansion during the late Republic?<br>(00:30:28) 这真是一套绝妙的融合流程。共和国后期的快速扩张，是不是就得益于这个原因？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:30:36) No. There it’s more the indigenous Italians who are in the army at that point. They haven’t really expanded the Auxiliaries yet. That’s more something that happens in the Empire. Yeah, so back it up. We have that first 250 years of the Roman Republic, from about 500 to let’s say 250 BC. And in that period, they gradually expand throughout Italy, conquer the other Italian cities, who are pretty much like them. They’re people who already speak similar languages or the same language, have the same gods. It’s easy to integrate them. That’s the ones they make the half citizens and allies.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:30:36) 不是的。共和国后期军队的主力，更多是意大利本地人。当时辅助部队制度还没有真正推广开来，辅助部队更多是帝国时期的产物。我们回溯一下历史：罗马共和国的前 250 年（约公元前 500 年至公元前 250 年），罗马逐步征服了意大利全境，而被征服的意大利城邦与罗马本身非常相似 —— 他们语言相近甚至相通，信奉相同的神明，因此很容易融入罗马体系。这些族群就是罗马授予 “半公民权” 或吸纳为盟友的对象。</p>
<p>(00:31:13) Then in the second half of that period, from about 250 to let’s say 30 BC, Rome goes outside of Italy, and this is a new world because now they’re encountering people who are really fundamentally different. So, true others. They do not have the same gods. They don’t speak the same language. They have fundamentally different systems of economy, everything.</p>
<p>(00:31:13) 到了共和国后半段（约公元前 250 年至公元前 30 年），罗马的扩张范围超出了意大利，进入了一个全新的世界 —— 他们开始接触与自己差异极大的族群，真正的 “外来者”。这些族群信奉不同的神明，说着完全不同的语言，经济体系和社会结构也与罗马截然不同。</p>
<p>(00:31:34) Rome first expands in the Western Mediterranean, and there their big rival is the city state of Carthage, which is another city founded almost the same time as Rome that has also been a young, vigorously expanding aggressive empire. In the Western Empire at this time, you have two sort of rival groups, and they’re very different because the Romans are these citizen soldier farmers…</p>
<p>(00:31:34) 罗马首先向地中海西部扩张，而当地的主要竞争对手是迦太基城邦（Carthage）。迦太基与罗马几乎同时建立，当时也是一个年轻、极具扩张性的强势政权。彼时地中海西部有两个相互竞争的势力，且二者差异巨大 —— 罗马是 “公民 - 士兵 - 农民” 型社会，而迦太基则完全不同……</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:32:00) Because the Romans are these citizen soldier farmers, so the Romans are all these small farmers, that’s the basis of their economy, and it’s the Romans who serve in the army. So the person who is a citizen, is also really by main profession, a farmer, and then in times of war, becomes a soldier.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:32:00) 之所以说罗马是 “公民 - 士兵 - 农民” 型社会，是因为罗马的核心群体是小农，农业是经济基础，而公民同时也是军队的主体。也就是说，一名罗马公民的主要职业是农民，战时则应征入伍成为士兵。</p>
<p>(00:32:19) Carthage is an oligarchy of merchants, so it’s a very small citizen body. They make their money through maritime trade, so they have ships that go all over the Mediterranean. They don’t have a large army of Carthaginians. Instead, they hire mercenaries mostly to fight for them, so it’s almost these two rival systems. It’s different philosophies, different economies, everything.</p>
<p>(00:32:19) 迦太基则是由商人寡头统治的城邦，公民群体规模很小。他们通过海上贸易积累财富，商船遍布地中海；但迦太基没有大规模的本族军队，打仗主要依赖雇佣军。所以，罗马和迦太基是两种截然不同的体系 —— 理念、经济模式，方方面面都存在差异。</p>
<p>(00:32:45) Rome is strong on land. Carthage is strong at sea. So there’s this dichotomy, but they’re both looking to expand and they repeatedly come into conflict as they expand. So Carthage is on the coast of North Africa, Rome’s in Central Italy. What’s right between them? The island of Sicily. So the first big war is fought purely dictated by geography. Who gets Sicily, Rome or Carthage? And Rome wins in the end, they get it, but Carthage is still strong. They’re not weakened. So Carthage is now looking to expand.</p>
<p>(00:32:45) 罗马的优势在陆地，迦太基的优势在海上，双方形成了这种 “陆海对立” 的格局。但两者都在扩张，扩张过程中不可避免地多次爆发冲突。迦太基位于北非海岸，罗马位于意大利中部，两者之间的关键地带是什么？是西西里岛。因此，第一次大规模战争的爆发完全由地理因素决定：西西里岛该归罗马还是迦太基？最终罗马获胜，夺取了西西里岛，但迦太基实力未损，仍在寻求扩张。</p>
<p>(00:33:16) The next place to go is Spain. So they go and take Spain. Rome, meanwhile, is moving along the coast of what today’s France. Where are they going to meet up? On the border of Spain and France. And there’s a city, at this point in time called Saguntum. The second big war between Rome and Carthage is over. Who gets Saguntum?</p>
<p>(00:33:16) 迦太基接下来的扩张目标是西班牙，他们成功控制了西班牙地区。与此同时，罗马正沿着如今法国的海岸向北扩张。双方的下一个冲突点在哪里？就在西班牙与法国的边境地带，当时那里有一座名为萨贡托（Saguntum）的城市。于是，罗马与迦太基的第二次大规模战争，就围绕 “萨贡托归属权” 展开。</p>
<p>(00:33:34) So, I mean, you can just look at a map and see this stuff coming. Sometimes geography is inevitability, and I think in the course of the wars between Rome and Carthage called the Punic Wars, there is this geographic inevitability to them.</p>
<p>(00:33:34) 其实只要看看地图，就能预见到这些冲突的发生。有时候地理因素会决定历史的走向，我认为罗马与迦太基之间的 “布匿战争”（Punic Wars），就带有这种地理必然性。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:33:47) Can you speak to the Punic Wars? There’s so many levels on which we can talk about this, but why was Rome victorious?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:33:47) 您能详细讲讲布匿战争吗？我们可以从很多角度讨论这个话题，但罗马最终获胜的原因是什么？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:33:56) Well, the Punic Wars really almost always comes down to the second Punic War. There’s three. There’s three Punic Wars. The first is over Sicily, Rome wins. The second is the big one, and it’s the big one because Carthage at this point in time, just by sheer luck, coughs up one of the greatest military geniuses in all of history.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:33:56) 布匿战争的核心，其实几乎都集中在第二次布匿战争上。布匿战争总共打了三次：第一次是为争夺西西里岛，罗马获胜；第二次是规模最大、影响最深远的一次 —— 因为当时的迦太基恰巧出了一位人类历史上最伟大的军事天才之一。</p>
<p>(00:34:15) This guy, Hannibal Barca, he was actually the son of the Carthaginian general who fought Rome for Sicily. Hamilcar was his father, but Hannibal is this just genius, just absolute military genius. He goes to Spain. He’s the one who kind of organizes stuff there, and now he knows the second war with Rome is inevitable. And so, the question is how do you take down Rome? He’s smart. He’s seen Rome’s strength. He knows it’s the Italian allies.</p>
<p>(00:34:15) 这个人就是汉尼拔・巴卡（Hannibal Barca），他其实是曾与罗马争夺西西里岛的迦太基将领哈米尔卡（Hamilcar）的儿子。但汉尼拔本人是真正的军事奇才，绝对的天才。他前往西班牙，在当地整合势力，并且清楚地知道，与罗马的第二次战争已不可避免。于是问题来了：如何击败罗马？汉尼拔很聪明，他看清了罗马的核心优势 —— 意大利盟友。</p>
<p>(00:34:45) So Rome always wins because even if they lose battles, they go to the Italian allies and half citizens and raise new armies. So how do you beat them? He can never raise that many troops himself. And Hannibal, I think correctly figures out the one way to maybe defeat Rome is to cut them away from their allies. Well, how do you do this?</p>
<p>(00:34:45) 罗马之所以总能赢，是因为即便输掉几场战役，他们也能从意大利盟友和半公民中征召兵力，组建新的军队。那么，该如何打破这种循环？汉尼拔自己无法征召足够多的兵力，所以他准确地判断出：击败罗马的唯一办法，或许是切断罗马与盟友的联系。但该怎么做呢？</p>
<p>(00:35:06) Hannibal’s plan is, I’m not going to wait and fight the Romans in Spain or North Africa. I’m going to invade Italy. So I’m going to strike at the heart of this growing Roman Empire, and my hope is that if I can win a couple big battles against Rome in Italy, the Italians will want their freedom back and they’ll rebel from Rome and maybe even join me, because most people who have been conquered want their freedom back, so this is a reasonable plan.</p>
<p>(00:35:06) 汉尼拔的计划是：不被动等待在西班牙或北非与罗马交战，而是主动入侵意大利 —— 直击这个崛起中罗马帝国的核心。他的设想是：如果能在意大利境内打赢几场大仗，意大利各城邦就会渴望重获自由，进而反抗罗马，甚至可能加入自己的阵营。毕竟，大多数被征服者都希望摆脱控制，这个计划在当时是合理的。</p>
<p>(00:35:37) So Hannibal famously crosses the Alps with elephants, dramatic stuff. Nobody expects him to do this. Nobody thinks you can do this. Shows up in Northern Italy. Romans send an army. Hannibal massacres them. He is a military genius. Rome takes a year, raises a second army. We know this story, sends it against Hannibal. Hannibal wipes them out.</p>
<p>(00:35:37) 于是就有了汉尼拔著名的 “翻越阿尔卑斯山” 行动，场面极具戏剧性。没人想到他会这么做，也没人认为这可行。但他成功抵达了意大利北部，罗马随即派遣一支军队迎战，结果被汉尼拔击溃 —— 他的军事才能确实超凡。罗马花了一年时间组建第二支军队，再次派去对抗汉尼拔，又被全歼。</p>
<p>(00:35:57) Rome gets clever this time. They say, okay, Hannibal’s different. We’re going to take two years, raise two armies and send them both out at the same time against Hannibal. So they do this, and this is the Battle of Cannae, which is one of the most famous battles in history, Hannibal’s facing this army of 80,000 Romans about, and he comes up with a strategy called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it’s this famous strategy where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides, and in one afternoon at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans.</p>
<p>(00:35:57) 这次罗马学聪明了，他们意识到汉尼拔与以往的对手不同。于是他们花了两年时间组建了两支军队，同时派往战场对抗汉尼拔。这场战役就是历史上著名的 “坎尼会战”（Battle of Cannae）。当时汉尼拔面对的罗马军队约有 8 万人，他想出了 “双重包围” 战术 —— 如果之后你想深入了解，我们可以再细聊，但简单来说，这是一种经典战术：先引诱罗马军队深入，再从四面八方将其包围。在坎尼会战的一个下午，汉尼拔就歼灭了约 6 万名罗马士兵。</p>
<p>(00:36:36) Now, just to put that in perspective, that’s more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam. I mean, the Battle of Gettysburg, which lasted three days and was one of the bloodiest battles of civil war, I think the actual deaths at that were maybe like 15,000. So this is a bloodshed of an almost unimaginable scale.</p>
<p>(00:36:36) 我们可以对比一下，感受这场屠杀的规模：一个下午被刀剑砍杀的罗马人数量，比美国在越南战争 20 年间阵亡的人数还多；美国南北战争中最惨烈的葛底斯堡战役持续了三天，阵亡人数大概也只有 1.5 万。所以坎尼会战的血腥程度，在当时是难以想象的。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:37:01) It’s also brutal…</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:37:01) 这也太残酷了……</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:37:02) Yes.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:37:02) 确实如此。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:37:03) … just to slaughter.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:37:03) … 简直是屠杀。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:37:03) I mean, it’s just mind boggling to think of that. So now, this is Rome’s darkest hour. This is why the second Punic War is important, because there’s that Nietzsche phrase, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” this is the closest Rome comes to death in the history of the Republic. Hannibal almost kills Rome, but no, it’s not much of a spoiler.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:37:03) 现在回想起来，依然觉得不可思议。坎尼会战之后，罗马陷入了历史上最黑暗的时刻 —— 这也是第二次布匿战争如此重要的原因。尼采有句名言：“那些杀不死你的，会让你更强大”，而此时的罗马，正处于共和国历史上最接近 “死亡” 的时刻。汉尼拔几乎摧毁了罗马，但（说出来不算剧透）罗马最终还是挺了过来。</p>
<p>(00:37:28) Rome’s going to survive, and from this point on, they’re going to be unbeatable, but this is the crisis. This is the crucible. This is the furnace that Rome passes through, that is the dividing point between when they’re one more up and coming empire and when they’re clearly the dominant power in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>(00:37:28) 罗马不仅活了下来，而且从这一刻起，几乎变得不可战胜。这场危机就像一座熔炉，罗马在其中淬炼重生 —— 这是罗马从 “又一个崛起中的帝国” 转变为 “地中海绝对霸主” 的分水岭。</p>
<p>(00:37:44) So what do they do about Hannibal? Well, they’re smart. We’re not going to fight Hannibal. We’re not going to give Hannibal the chance to kill more Romans. So they adopt a strategy that they’ll follow Hannibal, when they raise a couple more armies, follow Hannibal round, but whenever Hannibal turns and tries to attack them, the Romans just back off. No, thank you. We’re not going to let you give you a chance.</p>
<p>(00:37:44) 那么罗马是如何应对汉尼拔的呢？他们采取了一个聪明的策略：不再与汉尼拔正面交战，避免更多罗马士兵阵亡。在组建了几支新军队后，他们只是跟在汉尼拔的军队后面，但每当汉尼拔转身试图进攻，罗马军队就撤退 ——“不，谢谢，我们不会给你交战的机会。”</p>
<p>(00:38:07) Meanwhile though, they’re not scared of other Carthaginians, so they raise a couple more armies and they send these to Spain, for example, and start attacking the Carthaginian holdings there. And by luck or necessity, Rome comes up with its own brilliant commander at this point, a guy named Scipio, and he wins victories in Spain, conquers Spain. Then, he crosses into North Africa and starts to conquer that and ends up threatening Carthage directly.</p>
<p>(00:38:07) 但与此同时，罗马并不惧怕其他迦太基军队。他们又组建了几支军队，派往西班牙等地，开始攻击迦太基在当地的据点。或许是运气，或许是必然，罗马此时也涌现出了一位杰出的将领 —— 西庇阿（Scipio）。他在西班牙取得胜利，征服了西班牙地区，随后率军渡过地中海进入北非，开始征服迦太基本土，直接威胁到迦太基城的安全。</p>
<p>(00:38:34) And poor Hannibal, undefeated in Italy, has now been walking up and down Italy or marching up and down Italy for 12 years looking for another fight, and the Romans won’t give it to them. They’ve been attacking all these other areas and chipping away at Carthaginian power.</p>
<p>(00:38:34) 而汉尼拔呢？他在意大利境内未尝一败，却在意大利土地上转战了 12 年，始终找不到与罗马正面决战的机会。与此同时，罗马通过攻击其他地区，不断削弱迦太基的实力。</p>
<h2 id="Conquering-Greece"><a href="#Conquering-Greece" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Greece"></a><strong>Conquering Greece</strong></h2><h2 id="征服希腊"><a href="#征服希腊" class="headerlink" title="征服希腊"></a><strong>征服希腊</strong></h2><p>(00:38:52) So finally, after more than a decade in Italy, Hannibal is called back to defend the homeland, defend Carthage from Scipio. The two meet in a big battle. This should be one of the great battles of all times the Battle of Zama, but Hannibal’s guys are kind of old by this point. Scipio has all the advantages. He wins. Carthage is defeated. So that’s pretty much the end of Carthage.</p>
<p>Conquering Greece<br>(00:38:52) 最终，在意大利征战了十多年后，汉尼拔被召回迦太基本土，抵御西庇阿的进攻。两位名将在北非展开决战 —— 这场 “扎马会战”（Battle of Zama）本应成为历史上最伟大的战役之一，但此时汉尼拔的军队已显老态，西庇阿则占据了所有优势，最终西庇阿获胜，迦太基被击败。至此，迦太基的辉煌基本落幕。</p>
<p>(00:39:15) The city survives, and then 50 years later, the Romans wipe it out, but that’s not much of a war. But from this moment on, from the second Punic War, which ends in 201 BC, Rome is undisputably the most powerful force nation in the Mediterranean world, and having conquered the West, they’re now going to turn to the East, which is the Greek world, and the Greek world is older. It’s richer, it’s the rich part, half of the Mediterranean, it’s culturally more sophisticated. It’s the world left by Alexander the Great, that’s ruled by the descendants of his generals.</p>
<p>(00:39:15) 迦太基城虽然在当时得以留存，但 50 年后还是被罗马彻底摧毁 —— 不过那已经算不上一场真正的战争了。而从第二次布匿战争（公元前 201 年结束）开始，罗马已成为地中海世界无可争议的最强力量。征服了西部后，罗马将目光转向了东部 —— 希腊世界。当时的希腊世界历史更悠久、更富庶（占据了地中海一半的富庶地区），文化也更精深，是亚历山大大帝留下的遗产，由他的将领后代统治。</p>
<p>(00:39:50) And the Greeks kind of view themselves as superior to the Romans. I mean, to the Greeks, the Romans are these uncouth sort of savage barbarians, but they’re going to get a real shock because the Roman army now has gotten really good to beat Hannibal. And when they go East, they’re going to just defeat the Greeks relatively easily, one after the other.</p>
<p>(00:39:50) 希腊人当时多少有些看不起罗马人 —— 在他们眼中，罗马人是粗鲁的 “野蛮部落”。但希腊人很快就要迎来巨大的冲击：为了击败汉尼拔，罗马军队的战斗力已大幅提升，当他们进军东部时，击败希腊各邦的过程相对轻松，一个接一个地征服了希腊世界。</p>
<p>(00:40:11) And there’s a famous historian named Polybius who is a Greek whose city was captured by the Romans. He later becomes a friend to the Scipio family. He actually teaches some of the Scipio children about Greek culture. And he writes a history of Rome and his motivation for writing this is he says, at the beginning of this book, he says, “Surely there can be no one so incurious as to not want to understand how the Romans could have conquered the entire Greek world in 53 years,” because that seems unimaginable to him.</p>
<p>(00:40:11) 当时有一位著名的历史学家叫波里比阿（Polybius），他是希腊人，家乡被罗马攻陷。后来他成为西庇阿家族的朋友，甚至教西庇阿的孩子学习希腊文化。波里比阿撰写了一部罗马史，他在书的开头就说明了自己的写作动机：“想必不会有人如此缺乏好奇心，不想知道罗马人是如何在 53 年内征服整个希腊世界的吧？”—— 因为在他看来，这简直是不可思议的事情。</p>
<h2 id="Scipio-vs-Hannibal"><a href="#Scipio-vs-Hannibal" class="headerlink" title="Scipio vs Hannibal"></a>Scipio vs Hannibal</h2><h2 id="西庇阿对决汉尼拔"><a href="#西庇阿对决汉尼拔" class="headerlink" title="西庇阿对决汉尼拔"></a>西庇阿对决汉尼拔</h2><p>(00:40:46) So he’s writing this entire history as a way to try and understand how did the Romans do it? We were these wonderful superior people, and they came around in 50 years, bang, that’s the end of us. So that’s his motivation.</p>
<p>Scipio vs Hannibal<br>(00:40:46) 所以他撰写整部史书，就是为了弄明白一个问题：罗马人是怎么做到的？我们希腊人如此优秀，却在 50 年间就被罗马人征服，这到底是为什么？这就是他写作的核心动力。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:40:59) Could you maybe speak to any interesting details of the military genius of Hannibal or Scipio? At that time, what are some interesting aspects this double envelopment idea?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:40:59) 您能讲讲汉尼拔或西庇阿军事才能中的一些有趣细节吗？比如当时的 “双重包围” 战术，有哪些值得关注的特点？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:41:10) I mean, Hannibal is good because he understood how to use different troop types and to play to their strengths and how to use terrain. So I mean, this is basic military stuff, but he did it really well. So one is his victories against the Romans, for example, is when the Romans are marching along the edge of a lake and their army is strung out in marching formations.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:41:10) 汉尼拔的厉害之处，在于他懂得如何运用不同类型的部队，发挥每种部队的优势，并且善于利用地形。这些虽然是基础的军事原则，但他执行得极为出色。比如，他在某次对罗马的胜利中，就是利用了地形优势：当时罗马军队正沿着湖边行军，队伍呈行军阵型拉长排列。</p>
<p>(00:41:32) They’re not kind of in combat formation, but they’re strung out along the edge of this lake. It’s misty. There’s not good visibility, and he ambushes them along this lakeside, so Lake Trasimene, and it’s just using the terrain, understanding this. Again, Hannibal is very much outnumbered, but he’s able to use the terrain and to take the enemy by surprise.</p>
<p>(00:41:32) 罗马军队当时并没有排成作战阵型，只是沿着湖边一字长蛇阵行进。当时雾气很重，能见度低，汉尼拔就在湖边设伏 —— 这场战役就是 “特拉西梅诺湖战役”（Battle of Lake Trasimene）。他正是通过对地形的利用和出其不意的战术，以少胜多击败了罗马军队。</p>
<p>(00:41:51) At Cannae, he’s working against the expectations. So the traditional thing you do in the ancient world is the two armies would line up on opposite sides of a field, you’d put your best troops in the middle, you’d put your cavalry on the sides, you’d put your lightly armed skirmishers beyond those, and then the two sides kind of smack together, and the good troops fight the good, and you see who wins.</p>
<p>(00:41:51) 而在坎尼会战中，汉尼拔则打破了当时的战术常规。在古代世界，传统的作战方式是：两支军队在战场两端列队，将最精锐的部队部署在中路，骑兵部署在两翼，轻装散兵则在更外侧；之后双方正面冲锋，精锐部队对撞，最终看哪一方获胜。</p>
<p>(00:42:15) Now, Hannibal is hugely outnumbered by this giant phalanx of heavy infantry, which is what the Romans specialized in. They’re very good at sort of heavily armed foot soldiers. So he knows I don’t want to go up against that. I don’t have that many of that troop type. My guys aren’t as good as the Romans anyway.</p>
<p>(00:42:15) 当时，罗马军队的核心是重装步兵方阵，在兵力上远超汉尼拔 —— 重装步兵正是罗马的专长，他们的重装步兵战斗力极强。汉尼拔很清楚，自己不能与罗马正面硬拼：一方面他没有足够多的重装步兵，另一方面他的步兵战斗力也不如罗马。</p>
<p>(00:42:33) So he lines up some of his less good troops in the center against the big menacing Roman phalanx, and he tells them, “Okay, when the Romans come, you’re not really trying to win, just hold them up. Just delay them,” and even tells them you can give ground, so you can retreat and sort of let the line form a big kind of C-shaped crescents, let the Romans sort of advance into you, but just hold that line.</p>
<p>(00:42:33) 于是，他将己方战斗力较弱的部队部署在中路，正面应对罗马极具威慑力的重装方阵，并下令：“罗马人进攻时，你们不用想着获胜，只要拖住他们、拖延时间就行”—— 他甚至允许这些部队后撤，让战线形成一个巨大的 “C” 形新月状，引诱罗马军队深入，但必须守住这条防线。</p>
<p>(00:42:58) And meanwhile, he puts his cavalry and his good troops on the side, and so on the sides, those good troops defeat the Romans, and then they kind of circle in behind the Romans and attack that big menacing Roman phalanx from the rear where it’s very vulnerable. And so, Hannibal catches the Romans in this sort of giant cauldron just with people closing in from both sides, and they get pressed together. They can’t fight properly, they panic, and they’re all slaughtered.</p>
<p>(00:42:58) 与此同时，他将骑兵和精锐部队部署在两翼。战斗开始后，两翼的精锐部队先击败了罗马的侧翼兵力，随后绕到罗马军队后方，攻击罗马重装方阵最薄弱的后背。就这样，汉尼拔把罗马军队困在了一个 “大熔炉” 里 —— 敌军从两侧和后方不断逼近，罗马士兵被挤在一起，无法正常作战，陷入恐慌，最终几乎被全歼。</p>
<h2 id="Heavy-infantry-vs-Cavalry"><a href="#Heavy-infantry-vs-Cavalry" class="headerlink" title="Heavy infantry vs Cavalry"></a>Heavy infantry vs Cavalry</h2><h2 id="重步兵与骑兵"><a href="#重步兵与骑兵" class="headerlink" title="重步兵与骑兵"></a>重步兵与骑兵</h2><p>(00:43:27) And that strategy of double envelopment, of sort of going around both sides becomes the model for all kinds of military strategies throughout the rest of history. I mean, the Germans use this in their Blitzkrieg in World War II, a lot of it was kind of that go around the sides and envelop the enemy. On the eastern front, they had a bunch of these cauldron battles where they would go around and try to encircle huge chunks of the Soviet, the Russian army, and do the same thing.</p>
<p>Heavy infantry vs Cavalry<br>(00:43:27) 这种 “双重包围” 战术 —— 即从两翼包抄敌军的策略，在此后的整个军事史上成为了各类战术的范本。比如二战时期，德国在 “闪电战” 中就运用了类似思路，核心就是从侧翼迂回、包围敌军；在东线战场，德军还打了多场 “围歼战”，绕到苏军后方，试图包围大规模苏军部队，用的正是这种战术。</p>
<p>(00:43:54) Supposedly even in the Gulf War, it was part of the US strategy for the invasion of Iraq to do this kind double envelopment maneuver. So it’s something that for the rest of military history, has been an inspiration to other armies.</p>
<p>(00:43:54) 据说在海湾战争中，美军入侵伊拉克的战略里，也包含了这种双重包围战术。可见在整个军事史上，汉尼拔的这一战术一直为其他军队提供着灵感。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:44:06) Can you speak to maybe, the difference between heavy infantry and cavalry, the usefulness of it in the ancient world?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:44:06) 您能讲讲重装步兵和骑兵的区别，以及它们在古代战场上的作用吗？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:44:12) The ancient world, sort of from the Greeks through the Romans, there’s this consistent line of focusing on heavy infantry. So going back to Greece when they’re fighting, let’s say Persia, which at the time, was the superpower of the ancient world and vastly richer, vastly larger than Ancient Greece, tons more men, but the Persians tended to be archers, tended to be light horsemen tended to be light infantry.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:44:12) 在古代世界，从希腊到罗马，有一个一贯的战术核心 —— 重视重装步兵。回溯到希腊与波斯作战的时代：当时波斯是古代世界的超级大国，比古希腊富有得多、疆域辽阔得多、兵力也多得多，但波斯军队的主力多是弓箭手、轻骑兵和轻装步兵。</p>
<p>(00:44:40) Whereas the Greeks specialized in what are called hop lights, which is a kind of infantrymen with very heavy body armor, a helmet, a spear, and a really big heavy shield. And they would get in that formation where you kind of make the shields overlap and just form this solid mass bristling with spear points and just slowly kind of march forward and grind up your enemy in front of you. And so, that’s that sort of block of heavy infantry.</p>
<p>(00:44:40) 而希腊则专注于培养 “重装步兵”（hoplites）—— 这类步兵装备着厚重的盔甲、头盔、长矛和巨大的重型盾牌。他们会排成 “方阵”（phalanx）：士兵们将盾牌相互重叠，形成一个密集的 “盾墙”，矛尖朝外，然后缓慢向前推进，碾压前方的敌人。这就是重装步兵方阵的作战方式。</p>
<p>(00:45:07) The advantage is head on against other things, they tend to win. The disadvantage is it’s slow moving. It’s vulnerable from the sides and the rear, so you got to protect those, but if you can keep frontally faced, it’s pretty much invincible. And that’s taken even further by Alexander the Great who comes up with the idea, well, what if we even give them a longer spear? So Greek spears were six to eight feet long. Alexander the Great, arms his armies with the sarissa, which is this 15 foot, almost a pike, this extra long spear.</p>
<p>(00:45:07) 重装步兵的优势在于：正面作战时几乎所向披靡；劣势则是移动缓慢，且侧翼和后方防御薄弱，必须专门派人保护 —— 但只要能保持正面迎敌，他们就几乎不可战胜。亚历山大大帝进一步强化了这一战术：他想，“如果给重装步兵配备更长的矛会怎样？” 希腊传统长矛长 6 到 8 英尺，而亚历山大为军队配备了 “萨里萨长矛”（sarissa）—— 这种长矛长达 15 英尺，几乎相当于一支长枪，长度远超传统长矛。</p>
<p>(00:45:41) And so, when the spear is that long, you don’t even hardly need the shields anymore. So it’s just this incredibly powerful thing in frontal attack, and that’s what he uses to make himself ruler of the known world. He goes and conquers the Persian Empire and makes himself the Persian king of kings with this phalanx of troops armed with the sarissa. So that’s very powerful.</p>
<p>(00:45:41) 长矛变长后，士兵甚至几乎不需要盾牌了 —— 这种重装方阵在正面进攻时威力惊人，亚历山大正是依靠这支装备萨里萨长矛的方阵，征服了波斯帝国，成为 “万王之王”，统治了当时已知的世界。可见这种战术的威力有多强。</p>
<p>(00:46:03) The Romans go a little bit different route. They have heavy infantry, but they focus more on fighting with short swords, so it’s get up close and kind of stab. And the other thing the Romans do is they focus on flexibility and subdividing their army. So Alexander’s phalanx was a mass of let’s say, 5,000 guys and it was one unit.</p>
<p>(00:46:03) 罗马则走了一条略有不同的路。他们也有重装步兵，但更注重用短剑作战 —— 也就是近距离刺杀。此外，罗马军队的核心特点是 “灵活性” 和 “部队细分”。比如亚历山大的方阵是一个由 5000 人组成的单一作战单位，整体性强但不够灵活。</p>
<p>(00:46:27) The Roman army is organized in an ever decreasing number of subunits. So you have a group of eight guys who are a contubernia, the men who share a tent, you take 10 of those and they form a century of 80 men. You take a bunch of those and you form a cohort. If you forget a bunch of those, you form a legion.</p>
<p>(00:46:27) 而罗马军队则被划分为层层递减的小型作战单位：8 名士兵组成一个 “帐篷队”（contubernia，即共同住一顶帐篷的士兵群体）；10 个帐篷队组成一个 “百人队”（century，共 80 人）；若干个百人队组成一个 “大队”（cohort）；若干个大队再组成一个 “军团”（legion）。</p>
<p>(00:46:44) So the Romans are able to subdivide their army, and the big sticking point comes at 197 BC at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, when the Roman Legion goes up against one of the descendants of Alexander the Great, who’s using his military system. So this is the new Roman system with flexibility versus the old invincible Alexander system with the heavily armed sarissa with those long 15-foot poles.</p>
<p>(00:46:44) 这种细分让罗马军队具备了灵活调度的能力。公元前 197 年的 “库诺斯克法莱战役”（Battle of Cynoscephalae）就是关键转折点：罗马军团对阵亚历山大将领后代统领的军队 —— 对方沿用了亚历山大的战术体系（即装备 15 英尺萨里萨长矛的重装方阵），而罗马则用的是灵活的新型战术体系。</p>
<h2 id="Armor"><a href="#Armor" class="headerlink" title="Armor"></a>Armor</h2><h2 id="盔甲"><a href="#盔甲" class="headerlink" title="盔甲"></a>盔甲</h2><p>(00:47:10) And the key moment in the battle is where they lock together And in a head-on clash, the Macedonians are going to win, but the Romans have the flexibility to break off a little section of their army, run around to the side, and attack that formation from the side, and they win the battle. So they prove tactically superior because of their flexibility. So it’s always development and counter development in military history.</p>
<p>Armor<br>(00:47:10) 战役的关键转折点出现在双方正面交锋时：若纯粹正面硬碰硬，马其顿军队本可获胜，但罗马军队凭借灵活性，抽调出一小支兵力绕到马其顿方阵侧翼，从侧面发起进攻，最终赢得了战役。由此可见，正是灵活性让罗马在战术上占据了优势。军事史上的发展，向来都是 “一方创新、另一方应对” 的循环过程。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:47:34) A fascinating, brutal testing, ground of tactics and technology</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:47:34) 古代战场真是个既迷人又残酷的地方，堪称战术与技术的 “试验场”。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:47:38) Adaptation, you have to keep adapting.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:47:38) 核心就在于 “适应”—— 必须不断调整、不断适应。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:47:41) That’s, I think, the key thing. One of the fascinating things about your work, you study Roman life life in the ancient world, but also the details, like we mentioned, you are an expert in armor. So what kind of, maybe you could speak to weapons and most importantly, armor that were used by the Romans or by people in the ancient world.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:47:41) 我觉得这正是关键所在。您的研究有一点特别吸引人：您不仅研究罗马人的生活、古代社会的全貌，还关注很多细节 —— 比如我们之前提到的，您是盔甲领域的专家。所以想请您讲讲罗马人或古代人使用的武器，尤其是盔甲有哪些种类？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:48:05) I do military history. So I mean, the Romans specialized in, I mean, early on they have pretty random armor, and it’s not standardized. I mean, remember, there’s no factories in the ancient world, so nobody’s cranking out 10,000 units of exactly the same armor. Each one is handmade. Now, there can be a degree of standardization, even as early as Alexander, there was a certain amount of standardization, but each one is still handmade, and that’s important to keep in mind, each weapon, each piece of armor.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:48:05) 我主要研究军事史。罗马人的盔甲在早期其实很随意，没有统一标准。要知道，古代没有工厂，没人能批量生产出 1 万件完全一样的盔甲 —— 每一件都是手工制作的。当然，古代也存在一定程度的标准化，比如早在亚历山大时代就有了初步的标准，但即便如此，每件装备依然是手工打造。这一点很重要，无论是武器还是盔甲，都要记住这个背景。</p>
<p>(00:48:34) Armor develops over time to fit the tactics. So the Greek hoplites, are very heavy armor. The Roman infantrymen early in the public is lighter. Eventually they get this typical sort of chain mail shirt, helmet shield, the classic sort of Roman legionary, I would say, is the one of the first and second centuries AD, so the early Roman Empire, and this is the guy who wore bands of steel arranged in sort of bands around their body. So it looks almost like a lobster’s shell, right? And this is a thing called the lorica segmentata.</p>
<p>(00:48:34) 盔甲的发展始终是为了适配战术。比如希腊重装步兵（hoplites）的盔甲非常厚重；而罗马共和国早期的步兵盔甲则更轻便。到了罗马帝国早期（公元 1 至 2 世纪），罗马军团士兵的装备逐渐定型：他们会穿锁子甲，戴头盔，持盾牌 —— 最具代表性的是一种 “分段式钢甲”（lorica segmentata），钢片像环带一样环绕在身上，看起来几乎像龙虾壳。</p>
<p>(00:49:06) So it’s solid steel, which is very good protection, but it’s flexible because it has these individual bands that provide a lot of movement. And then, you have a helmet, you have a square shield that’s kind of curved, and you have the short sword, the Roman gladius and that’s the classic Roman legionary. Later, more things develop.</p>
<p>(00:49:06) 这种盔甲用实心钢打造，防护性极强，但又因为是分段式设计，灵活性很高，士兵活动起来不受限。再加上头盔、带弧度的方形盾牌，以及罗马短剑（gladius）—— 这就是我们印象中经典的罗马军团士兵形象。之后，盔甲技术还在不断发展。</p>
<p>(00:49:26) My personal relationship with armor is I got, really by accident, involved in this project to try to reconstruct this mysterious type of armor that was used, especially by the Greeks and Alexander the Great called the linothorax, which apparently was made only out of linen and glue. So this seems a little odd that that’s not the sort of material once you want metal or something, but we had clear literary references that people, including Alexander, and the most famous image of Alexander is this Alexander mosaic found at Pompeii that shows him wearing one of these funny types of armor.</p>
<p>(00:49:26) 我个人与盔甲的渊源，其实是偶然卷入了一个项目 —— 复原一种神秘的盔甲 “亚麻甲”（linothorax）。这种盔甲曾被希腊人，尤其是亚历山大大帝使用，材质显然只有亚麻和胶水。用亚麻和胶水做盔甲，听起来可能有点奇怪，毕竟大家通常会想到金属。但有明确的文献记载（包括提到亚历山大使用），而且庞贝古城发现的《亚历山大马赛克镶嵌画》中，亚历山大穿的就是这种特别的盔甲，图像证据很清晰。</p>
<p>(00:50:05) The catch is none survived. It’s organic materials. So we don’t have any of them and archaeologists like to study things that survive. So we have nice typologies of Greek armor made of bronze, Roman armor made of steel or sort of proto steel, but this thing, this linothorax was a mystery. And one of my undergraduate students, a guy named Scott Bartel, had a real, well, an Alexander obsession. He really loved Alexander.</p>
<p>(00:50:05) 问题在于，亚麻甲没有一件留存下来 —— 因为它是有机材质，早就腐烂了。考古学家通常研究能留存的文物，所以我们对希腊青铜甲、罗马钢甲（或原始钢甲）的分类很清晰，但亚麻甲始终是个谜。我的一个本科生斯科特・巴特尔（Scott Bartel）是个 “亚历山大迷”，特别痴迷于他。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:50:34) As one should.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:50:34) 确实，谁会不痴迷呢。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:50:35) He had Alexandros tattooed on his arm in Greek, and he was a smart student. He was really smart. And so, he, one summer, made himself an imitation of this thing of Alexander just for fun. And he said, “Can you give me some articles so I could do a better job?” So he used some scholarly articles about this armor, and with typical academic arrogance, I said, “Why, Scott, of course I will. I’ll give you some references,” and I went and looked and there weren’t any. So at that point, I was like, “Huh, tell you what, why don’t you and I look into this and try to do a reconstruction using only the materials they would’ve had in the ancient world?” And little did I know at the time, I thought, maybe I’ll get an article out of this, I mean, it ended up being a tenure project involving 150 students, a couple dozen other faculty members, and having three documentaries made out of it. And Scott and I ended up writing a scholarly book on this. So this is how, you never know where your next project’s going to come from.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:50:35) 他手臂上还纹了希腊文的 “亚历山大”（Alexandros），而且他很聪明，是个尖子生。有一年夏天，他出于兴趣，自己仿做了一件亚麻甲，然后问我：“能不能给我些相关论文，让我做得更专业点？” 我当时还带着学者常见的自负，说：“当然可以，斯科特，我给你找些参考文献。” 结果我翻遍资料，发现根本没有相关论文。这时候我就想：“不如我们一起研究吧，试着只用古代能获取的材料来复原它？” 当时我以为顶多能写篇论文，没想到最后这成了我的终身教职项目 —— 参与的学生有 150 人，还有几十位其他教职人员加入，甚至拍了三部纪录片。我和斯科特最后还合著了一本关于亚麻甲的学术著作。所以说，你永远不知道下一个研究项目会从哪里冒出来。</p>
<p>(00:51:34) So it started with this undergraduate turned into this huge thing, but it’s what we did. We first said, “All right, what are all the sources for this armor?” And in the end, we found 65 accounts of it in ancient literature by 40 different authors. So we have literary descriptions, and then we looked at ancient art, and we were able to identify about a thousand images in ancient art, in vase paintings, pottery, bronze sculpture, tomb paintings, all these different things showing this armor.</p>
<p>(00:51:34) 就这样，一个始于本科生兴趣的小想法，变成了一个大项目。我们首先做的是梳理亚麻甲的史料：最终在 40 位古代作者的文献中，找到了 65 处关于它的记载，有详细的文字描述。然后我们研究古代艺术作品，在花瓶彩绘、陶器、青铜雕塑、墓室壁画等不同载体上，识别出了约 1000 幅描绘亚麻甲的图像。</p>
<p>(00:52:05) And then, using those two things, we tried to backwards engineer a pattern to say, “Well, if this is what the end product look like, what does it have to look like when you make it?” And then we tried to reconstruct one of these things using only the glue and materials. So we had to use animal glues, rabbit glue. We had to end up sort of making our own linen, which comes from the flax plant. So we had to grow flax, harvest it, using only techniques in the ancient world, so modern flax goes through chemical processes. No, we had to do this the old-fashioned way, spin it into thread, so the thread into fabric, glue it all together.</p>
<p>(00:52:05) 基于这些文字和图像资料，我们尝试 “逆向推导” 制作方法：“既然成品是这个样子，制作过程中应该是什么步骤？” 然后我们开始复原 —— 只用古代的材料和胶水。我们用的是动物胶（比如兔胶）；亚麻布也得自己做：亚麻来自亚麻植物，我们要按古代方法种植、收割（现代亚麻会经过化学处理，我们完全不用），然后用传统方式纺线、织布，最后用胶水把布料粘合起来。</p>
<p>(00:52:41) And then, the fun part was once we made these things, we subjected them to ballistics testing. So we shot them with arrows, which again were wooden reconstruction arrows, using bronze arrowheads that were based on arrowheads found on ancient battlefields to determine how good protection would this thing have been. And of course, the kind of fun one that everyone always likes and that the documentaries always want is at one point they’re like, “Well, can you put Scott in one of these and shoot him?” And we’re like, “Okay.” I mean, at that point, we’ve done about a thousand test shots. I grew up shooting bows and arrows. I knew exactly how far that was going to go. So it’s one of these, don’t do this at home kids.</p>
<p>(00:52:41) 最有意思的环节是复原完成后的弹道测试。我们用仿制的古代木箭（箭头是根据古战场出土文物复刻的青铜箭头）射击亚麻甲，测试它的防护效果。当然，大家（包括纪录片团队）最感兴趣的是：“能不能让斯科特穿上亚麻甲，然后射他？” 我们说 “可以”—— 毕竟当时已经做了上千次射击测试，我从小就射箭，很清楚箭的射程和威力。不过还是要提醒：小朋友千万别在家模仿。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:53:19) So there’s a million questions to ask here, but in general, how well, in terms of ballistics, does it work? Can it withstand arrows or direct strikes from swords and axes and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:53:19) 这里有太多问题想问了，但总的来说，亚麻甲的弹道防护效果怎么样？能挡住箭吗？或者能承受剑、斧这类武器的直接攻击吗？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:53:30) Bottom line is a one centimeter thick linothorax, laminated, or even sewn. It doesn’t have to be laminated. Layer of linen is about as good protection as two millimeters of bronze, which was the thickest, comparable, body armor of bronze at the time. And we’re talking fourth century, fifth century BC here, so classical and Hellenistic Greece, and that would’ve protected you from, let’s say, random arrow strikes on the battlefield. So you could have gotten hit by arrows and they simply wouldn’t have gone through.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:53:30) 简单说，1 厘米厚的亚麻甲（无论是层压粘合的，还是纯缝制的 —— 其实不一定需要层压），防护效果相当于 2 毫米厚的青铜甲。而 2 毫米已经是当时青铜甲能达到的最厚厚度了（我们讨论的是公元前 4 至 5 世纪，即古典时期和希腊化时期的希腊）。在战场上，这种亚麻甲能挡住普通的箭矢攻击 —— 就算被箭射中，箭也穿不透。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:54:06) What are the benefits? Is there a major weight difference?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:54:06) 那它的优势是什么？重量上有明显差别吗？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:54:09) Yes. So the benefits of this are, it’s much lighter than metal armor. So the linothorax is about 11 pounds. A bronze cuirass of comparable protection would’ve been about 24 to 6 pounds. The chain mail shirt would be about 28, 27 pounds. It’s cooler. I mean, the Mediterranean is a hot place with the hot sun. Even today, a linen shirt is something you wear when you want to be cool. So it’s much lighter, that gives your troops greater endurance on the battlefield. They can run farther, fight longer. It’s cheaper. You don’t need a blacksmith who’s a specialist to make it.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:54:09) 优势很明显。首先是轻得多：一件亚麻甲约 11 磅（约 5 公斤），防护效果相当的青铜胸甲（cuirass）重 24 到 26 磅（约 11-11.8 公斤），锁子甲则有 27 到 28 磅（约 12.2-12.7 公斤）。其次是更凉爽：地中海地区阳光灼热，就算现在，亚麻材质也是避暑的选择。重量轻意味着士兵在战场上耐力更强 —— 能跑得更远，战斗更久。而且亚麻甲更便宜，不需要专业铁匠就能制作。</p>
<p>(00:54:46) In fact, probably, this is interesting, any woman in the ancient world could have made one of these because they were the ones who spun thread and sewed it into fabric. So I can easily see in a household a mother making this for her son, a wife making it for her husband. So it’s a form of armor you could have made domestically that would’ve been maybe not the greatest armor, but pretty good, pretty comparable to bronze armor.</p>
<p>(00:54:46) 有意思的是，古代的女性其实都能做亚麻甲 —— 因为纺线、织布本就是她们的日常工作。很容易想象这样的场景：一个家庭里，母亲为儿子做亚麻甲，妻子为丈夫做亚麻甲。所以这是一种 “家庭自制” 的盔甲，或许不是最顶级的，但防护效果很好，能和青铜甲媲美。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:55:14) And it’s amazing that you used all the materials they had at the time and none of the modern techniques, but I should probably say, maybe you can speak to that, they were probably much better at doing that than you are, right? Because again, generational, it’s a skill. It’s a skill that probably has practiced across decades, across centuries [inaudible 00:55:32].</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:55:14) 你们完全用古代材料、不借助任何现代技术来复原，这太厉害了。但我想，古代人做这个肯定比你们熟练得多，对吧？毕竟这是代代相传的手艺，经过了几百年、上千年的实践……（音频模糊）</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:55:32) I mean, in terms of producing the fabric, I’m sure they could do it 10 times faster than we could just, that’s a speed thing, but it’s still incredibly labor-intensive where I think there’s a big difference between our reconstruction and ancient ones is in the glue. So we ended up using a kind of least common denominator glue. We used rabbit glue because it would’ve been available anywhere and it’s cheap.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:55:32) 比如织布，古代人的速度肯定是我们的 10 倍 —— 这只是效率问题，但即便如此，织布依然非常耗费人力。不过我觉得，我们复原的亚麻甲和古代原版最大的差距在胶水上。我们最终用的是 “最基础款” 胶水 —— 兔胶，因为这种胶水在古代随处可得，而且成本低。</p>
<p>(00:55:55) But in the ancient world, they did have basically the equivalent of super glues. I mean, we found, for example, a helmets that were fished out river in Germany that had metal parts glued together that after 2,000 years of immersion and water were still glued together. So they had some great glues. We just don’t know what the recipes for them were. So we went the opposite tack and said, “Well, we’re just going to make something that we know they could have made.” So it was at least this good, you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p>(00:55:55) 但古代其实有类似 “超级胶水” 的东西。比如在德国的一条河里，我们发现了一个古代头盔，它的金属部件是用胶水粘在一起的 —— 在水里泡了 2000 年，这些部件居然还粘得很牢。可见他们的胶水质量极好，只是我们不知道具体配方。所以我们换了个思路：“我们只做古代人肯定能做出的版本”，也就是说，我们复原的亚麻甲，防护效果至少不会比古代的差。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:56:22) But actually, this is a materials thing, but I think glue, aside from helping glue things together, it can also be a thing that serves as armor. So if you glue things correctly, the way it permeates the material that is gluing, can strengthen the material…</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:56:22) 不过这其实涉及材料学 —— 我觉得胶水除了粘合，本身也能起到防护作用。如果涂胶方法得当，胶水渗透到材料里，就能增强材料的……</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:56:44) Yes.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:56:44) 没错。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:56:44) … the integrity of the material. That’s an art and the size probably that they understood deeply.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:56:44) … 材料强度。这其实是门手艺，古代人肯定对此深有研究。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:56:48) The process of lamination did add something. So there’s actually a huge debate among scholars and actually a sort of amateur archeologist that was this linothorax thing glued together or was it simply sewn together? Was it composite, partially linen, partially leather, or other materials? And my honest answer is I think it’s all of the above, because again, every piece of armor in the ancient world was an individual creation.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:56:48) 层压工艺（用胶水将多层材料粘合）确实能提升防护性。不过学者和业余考古爱好者之间有个很大的争议：亚麻甲到底是用胶水粘的，还是单纯缝的？它是不是复合材料 —— 比如部分用亚麻、部分用皮革或其他材料？说实话，我觉得以上情况都有可能，因为古代的每一件盔甲都是独一无二的手工制品。</p>
<p>(00:57:11) So I think if you had some spare leather, you put that in. If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together, or even quilted stuffed with stuff you do that, maybe you were good at gluing stuff, you use that. So I think there’s no one answer. We investigated one possibility because we just had limited time and money and resources, but I think all these other things existed at the same time and we’re variants of it.</p>
<p>(00:57:11) 比如家里有多余的皮革，就会加进去；想做纯缝制的，或者填点东西做成绗缝款，也可以；如果擅长用胶水，就用胶水粘合。所以没有唯一答案。我们只研究了其中一种可能性，因为时间、资金和资源都有限，但我相信其他制作方式在当时也存在，都是亚麻甲的不同变体。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:57:34) Just as a small aside, I just think this is a fascinating journey you went on. I love it. Sort of answering really important questions about, in this case, armor about military equipment and technology that archeologists can’t answer by using all the literary, so all the sources you can to understand what it looked like, what were the materials, using the materials at the time, and actually doing ballistic testing. It’s really cool. It’s really cool that you see that there’s a hole in the literature and nobody studied it, and going hard and doing it the right way to sort of uncover this. I don’t know, I think it’s an amazing mystery about the ancient world.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:57:34) 插句题外话，我觉得您这段研究经历太迷人了。考古学家可能无法解答关于盔甲、军事装备和技术的这类关键问题，但您通过梳理所有文献资料，弄清楚它的外观、材料，再用古代材料复原，还做了弹道测试 —— 这种方式太酷了。您发现文献里有空白，没人研究过这个领域，就全力以赴用科学的方法去探索，揭开古代的谜团。我觉得这真的很了不起。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:58:18) I mean, shifting from just sort of Roman history in general to my research that I’ve done as a scholar, the theme that runs throughout my scholarship is practical stuff. I’m interested, how did this actually work in the ancient world? So there’s people who are much more theoretical, who look at the symbolic meaning of something. I’m simpler. I just want to know how did this work? So almost all of my books that I’ve written, have started with some just how did something work, and I’m trying to just figure out that aspect of it, and that’s just, maybe it’s a personality thing.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:58:18) 从泛泛的罗马史研究，到我作为学者的专项研究，我所有研究的核心都是 “实用性”—— 我想知道这些东西在古代到底是怎么用的。有些人更侧重理论，会研究事物的象征意义，但我比较直接，就想弄明白 “它的运作原理是什么”。我写的几乎每本书，都是从 “某个东西怎么用” 这个问题开始的，然后专注于解答这个问题。可能这和我的性格有关吧。</p>
<p>(00:58:48) I also have a sciency background, so I think I’ve used a lot of that. Even though I’m a humanist and a historian, I’ve used a lot of hard science in my work. I did a book on floods where I had to get really heavy into vectors of disease and hydraulics and engineering and all that stuff, and I think, again, having that sort of hard science combined with a humanist background, helps with those sorts of projects.</p>
<p>(00:58:48) 我还有理科背景，所以在研究中会经常用到理科知识。虽然我是人文领域的学者、历史学家，但我的研究里融入了很多硬核科学。比如我写过一本关于洪水的书，里面就涉及疾病传播途径、水力学、工程学等内容。我觉得，理科背景加上人文视角，对这类研究很有帮助。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:59:12) Well, like you said, I think the details help you understand deeply the big picture of history. And I mean, Alexander the Great wore this thing.</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:59:12) 就像您说的，这些细节能帮我们更深刻地理解历史全貌。而且，亚历山大大帝当年就穿这种亚麻甲啊。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:59:19) Yeah.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:59:19) 没错。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:59:19) This is-</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(00:59:19) 这太……</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:59:20) And I should say by the way, it does drop out of use around Roman times. And I think what’s going on there is technology that with bronze, it’s hard to keep a sharp edge on things, but once you get into metals, which approximate steel, you can get sharper, and a key factor to penetrating fabric is the edge on the arrowhead.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(00:59:20) 不过顺便说一句，亚麻甲在罗马时期逐渐被淘汰了。我觉得原因和技术发展有关：青铜武器很难保持锋利，但到了接近钢的金属武器时代，刀刃能做得更锋利 —— 而能否穿透织物，箭头的锋利度是关键因素。</p>
<p>(00:59:43) So as soon as you start to get something more like a razor edge, it’s going to go through it more easily. Also, there’s changes in the bows that are being used. You start to get eastern horse archers showing up with composite bows, which are much more powerful. And so, it just becomes outdated as frontline military equipment. What’s interesting is by the Roman period, people are still wearing it, but it’s now things like when I go hunting, if I’m hunting lions, I wear this. There’s an actual source that says, “It’s really good for hunting dangerous big cats because it catches their teeth and stops them from penetrating. One emperor wears one of these under his toga. It’s kind of like a, not bulletproof vest, but stab proof vest. So again…</p>
<p>(00:59:43) 所以一旦武器有了类似剃刀的锋利边缘，就更容易穿透亚麻甲。另外，弓箭技术也在变化 —— 东方的骑兵弓箭手开始使用复合弓，威力大得多。因此，亚麻甲作为前线军事装备就过时了。但有趣的是，罗马时期人们还在穿它，只是用途变了：比如打猎时，尤其是猎狮子，会穿亚麻甲。有文献明确记载，“亚麻甲对付危险的大型猫科动物很有用，能缠住它们的牙齿，防止被咬穿”。还有一位罗马皇帝把亚麻甲穿在托加袍（toga）里面，相当于现在的防刺背心（不是防弹背心）。所以说……</p>
<h2 id="Alexander-the-Great"><a href="#Alexander-the-Great" class="headerlink" title="Alexander the Great"></a>Alexander the Great</h2><h2 id="亚历山大大帝"><a href="#亚历山大大帝" class="headerlink" title="亚历山大大帝"></a>亚历山大大帝</h2><p>(01:00:22) Awesome.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great<br>(01:00:22) 太厉害了。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:00:22) … it’s not to fight in the frontline of legions, but it’ll protect him from somebody trying to assassinate him. So it still has those uses where you’re not up against top line military equipment</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:00:22) … 它不再用于军团前线作战，但能防刺杀。在不需要对抗顶级军事装备的场景下，它依然有用。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(01:00:33) To honor aforementioned undergraduate student who loves Alexander the Great, we must absolutely talk about Alexander the Great for a little bit. Why was he successful, do you think, as a conqueror, probably one of the greatest conquerors in the history of humanity?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(01:00:33) 为了致敬那位喜欢亚历山大大帝的本科生，我们一定要聊聊亚历山大。您觉得他作为征服者为何能如此成功？他大概是人类历史上最伟大的征服者之一了。</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:00:49) Yeah, and I mean, that is then he one of the greatest heroes or one of the greatest villains in humanity, too. It’s like Julius Caesar. He’s famous for conquering Gaul. Well, about a million people were killed and a million enslaved in that. So does it make him a horrible person or one of our heroes?</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:00:49) 没错，而且他既是人类历史上最伟大的英雄之一，也可能是最可怕的反派之一 —— 就像尤利乌斯・凯撒。凯撒因征服高卢闻名，但在征服过程中，约有 100 万人被杀，100 万人被奴役。那么，这会让他成为可怕的暴君，还是人们眼中的英雄？</p>
<p>(01:01:04) But Alexander is a combination of two things, one is he really just was a skilled individual, and he was one of those guys who had it all. He was smart, he was athletic, and he was supremely charismatic. I mean, it’s obviously one of these people that would walk into a room and everyone just kind of gravitates to him. He had that magic that made him an effective leader.</p>
<p>(01:01:04) 但亚历山大的成功源于两点：首先，他个人能力极强，堪称 “全才”—— 聪明、体格健壮，还极具魅力。显然，他属于那种 “一进房间，所有人的目光都会被他吸引” 的人，拥有成为优秀领导者的 “魔力”。</p>
<p>(01:01:25) And secondly, he was lucky because it wasn’t all him. He inherited a system created by his father, Philip II. So he was in the right time at the right place and had this instrument placed in his hands, and then he had the intelligence and the charisma to go use it. So it’s one of these coming together of different things, but often his father’s contribution, I think, is not recognized as much as it is.</p>
<p>(01:01:25) 其次，他很幸运 —— 成功不全是他自己的功劳。他继承了父亲腓力二世（Philip II）建立的体系。可以说，他生逢其时、占据地利，手中握有现成的 “工具”（即父亲改革后的军队），而他又有智慧和魅力去运用这个工具。这是多种因素的结合，但我觉得他父亲的贡献往往没有得到足够认可。</p>
<p>(01:01:52) It’s his father who reformed the Macedonian army, who came up with that system of equipping them with the sarissa, this extra long spear that made them really effective, created the mixed army. So one of the keys to Alexander’s successes, in a tactical sense, is that his army was composed of different elements: heavy cavalry, light cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry, missile troops, and he understand that he can use these in different and flexible ways on the battlefield; whereas a lot of warfare before then had just been, you line up, two sides smashed together.</p>
<p>(01:01:52) 是他父亲改革了马其顿军队，发明了给士兵配备 “萨里萨长矛”（超长矛）的战术体系，让军队战斗力大幅提升，还创建了 “混合兵种军队”。从战术角度看，亚历山大成功的关键之一，就是他的军队包含多种兵种：重骑兵、轻骑兵、重装步兵、轻装步兵、投射部队 —— 他知道如何在战场上灵活运用这些兵种；而在此之前，很多战争的模式都是 “双方列队，正面硬拼”。</p>
<p>(01:02:25) So he did clever things with this army that was a better tool than others did. And then, he was just supremely ambitious. I mean, he cared about his fame, which I guess his ego, but he clearly cared about that more than he did about things like money. He was indifferent to that, and he did have a grand vision. So he did have this vision of trying to unite the world, both politically under his control, but also culturally, and this is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>(01:02:25) 他用这支 “更精良的工具”（军队）打出了很多精妙的战役。而且他极具野心 —— 他很在乎名声（或许可以说是 ego 强），但显然他对名声的重视远超过金钱，对财富毫不在意。他还有宏大的愿景：不仅想在政治上统一世界、置于自己统治之下，还想在文化上实现融合。这一点很有意思。</p>
<p>(01:02:55) So he was very open, in fact, insistent of trying to meld together the best elements of all the different cultures. So he, himself, was a Macedonian, but he admired Greek culture. So he pretty much adopted Greek culture as his own. When he conquers Persia, he starts adapting elements of Persian culture. He dresses in Persian clothing. He marries a Persian woman. He sort of forces thousands of his troops to marry local women. He appoints Persians to positions of power. He integrates Persian units into his military. He really wanted to fuse all these things together. And some people see this as a very enlightened vision that, “Oh, he’s not just, I want to conquer people and now they’re my slaves,” that he was really trying to create this one culture that was sort of the best of everything. Others see it, of course, as a form of cultural imperialism. You’re destroying other cultures and trying to warp or twist them into something, but what I think is interesting is that this vision he had of uniting cultures creates very problematic tensions among his own followers because the-</p>
<p>(01:02:55) 他非常开放，甚至极力主张融合不同文化的精华。他本身是马其顿人，但推崇希腊文化，几乎把希腊文化当成自己的文化。征服波斯后，他又开始吸收波斯文化元素：穿波斯服饰、娶波斯女子，还强迫数千名士兵与当地女性通婚，任命波斯人担任要职，将波斯部队编入自己的军队。他真的想把这些文化融合在一起。有人认为这是非常开明的愿景 ——“他不只是想征服别人、把他们变成奴隶，而是真的想创造一种集众家之长的统一文化”；但也有人认为，这本质上是 “文化帝国主义”—— 摧毁其他文化，再将其扭曲成自己想要的样子。不过我觉得最有意思的是，他这种文化融合的愿景，在自己的追随者中引发了巨大矛盾，因为……</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:04:00) Tensions among his own followers, because the Macedonians, his original troops, did not like this on the whole. They wanted the old model where we conquer you, you’re our slaves. We don’t want to share stuff with you. We don’t want you joining us in the army. We don’t want you appointed to positions of power. We are your conquerors and that’s it. And so, Alexander had to deal with a lot of friction from his own oldest, most loyal elements at the way he was being in their eyes, too generous to the conquered.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:04:00) … 这种矛盾主要来自他的追随者 —— 他的核心力量马其顿士兵，总体上不认同这种做法。他们想要的是 “传统模式”：我们征服你们，你们就是我们的奴隶；我们不想和你们分享权力，不想让你们加入军队，更不想让你们担任要职 —— 我们是征服者，仅此而已。因此，亚历山大不得不面对来自最资深、最忠诚部下的不满：在他们看来，亚历山大对被征服者实在太 “宽容” 了。</p>
<p>(01:04:31) So Alexander is one of these interesting personalities because every generation sees him in a new light and focuses on different things. So for some, he’s this enlightened visionary who was taught by Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, and they say, “Well, this influenced him.” Others see him as an egomaniacal warmonger, just I’m out to kill and gain glory. There was a book a couple of decades ago, it says, “Oh, he’s just an alcoholic,” which he probably was. Yeah. So you get all these competing images, and the great thing is, we don’t really know what the true Alexander was or what his motivations were. It’s a mixed message.</p>
<p>(01:04:31) 所以亚历山大是个极具争议的人物 —— 每一代人都会用新的视角看待他，关注他不同的侧面。对一些人来说，他是受希腊哲学家亚里士多德教导的 “开明远见者”，亚里士多德的思想影响了他；对另一些人来说，他是 “自大的好战分子”，满脑子只有杀戮和荣耀。几十年前还有一本书说 “他就是个酒鬼”—— 这或许也是事实。总之，关于他的形象众说纷纭，而最关键的是，我们其实根本不知道 “真实的亚历山大” 是什么样的，也不知道他的真实动机。他留给我们的，是一个复杂矛盾的形象。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(01:05:09) Why do you think the Roman Empire lasted while the Greek Empire as the Alexander expanded, did not?</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>(01:05:09) 您觉得为什么罗马帝国能长久存在，而亚历山大建立的希腊帝国却没能延续下去？</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:05:21) That’s a clear answer. So Alexander’s Empire fragmented the moment he died. And so his empire was all about personal loyalty. It was his charisma holding it together, his personality. And he completely failed to create a structure so that it would continue after his death. And of course, he died young. He didn’t think he would die when he did, but still, you should put something in place.</p>
<p>Gregory Aldrete<br>(01:05:21) 答案其实很明确。亚历山大一去世，他的帝国就分崩离析了。因为他的帝国完全建立在 “个人忠诚” 之上 —— 是他的魅力、他的个人特质在维系着整个帝国。他根本没有建立一个能在自己死后延续帝国的制度。当然，他去世时很年轻，可能没料到自己会这么早离世，但即便如此，他也应该提前做好制度安排。</p>
<p>(01:05:44) So his was a flash in the pan. It was, he had this spectacular conquest in 10 years. He conquered what was then most of the known world, but he had no permanent structure in place. He didn’t really deal with the issue of succession. It fell apart instantly. The Romans are much more about building a structure. I mean, as we talked about a little, they were very good about incorporating the people they conquered into the Roman project. I mean, they’re oppressive, they’re imperialistic as well. Let’s not whitewash them. I mean, they had moments when they would just wipe out entire cities. But on the whole, they were much more about trying to bring people into the Roman world. And I think that was one of their strengths, is that they were open to integration and bringing in different people to keep rejuvenating themselves.</p>
<p>(01:05:44) 所以他的帝国只是 “昙花一现”：他用 10 年时间完成了惊人的征服，占领了当时已知世界的大部分地区，但没有建立任何持久的制度，也没有解决 “继承问题”，所以一死帝国就垮了。而罗马人则更注重 “制度建设”。就像我们之前聊到的，他们很擅长将被征服者纳入 “罗马体系”。当然，罗马人也有压迫性，也是帝国主义者 —— 我们不能美化他们，比如他们也曾彻底摧毁过整座城市。但总体而言，他们更倾向于 “让被征服者融入罗马世界”。我认为这是罗马的核心优势之一：他们愿意接纳不同群体，通过融合来保持自身的活力。</p>
