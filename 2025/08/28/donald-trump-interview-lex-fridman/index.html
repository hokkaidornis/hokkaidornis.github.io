<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><h2 id="引言"><a href="#引言" class="headerlink" title="引言"></a>引言</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:00) I don’t know if you know this, but some people call you a fascist.<br>(00:00:00) 不知道你是否知情，有些人说你是法西斯分子。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:03) Yeah, they do. So I figure it’s all right to call them a communist. Yeah, they call me a lot worse than I call them.<br>(00:00:03) 是啊，他们确实这么说。那我觉得，我称他们为共产主义者也没什么问题。而且，他们对我的称呼可比我对他们的难听多了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:08) A lot of people listening to this, myself included, that doesn’t think that Kamala is a communist.<br>(00:00:08) 很多听这期播客的人 —— 包括我在内 —— 并不认为哈里斯是共产主义者。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:15) I believe you have to fight fire with fire.<br>(00:00:15) 我认为就得以牙还牙。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:17) Politics is a dirty game.<br>(00:00:17) 政治真是场肮脏的游戏。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:19) It is a dirty game. That’s certainly true.<br>(00:00:19) 确实是场肮脏的游戏，这一点毋庸置疑。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:21) How do you win at that game?<br>(00:00:21) 那要怎么在这场游戏中获胜呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:24) They suffer from massive Trump derangement syndrome, TDS, and I don’t know if it’s curable from their standpoint.<br>(00:00:24) 他们都患上了严重的 “特朗普失调症”（TDS，Trump Derangement Syndrome），而且在我看来，他们这病可能治不好了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:35) I think we would probably have a better world if everybody in Congress took some mushrooms perhaps?<br>(00:00:35) 我在想，如果国会议员们都吃点致幻蘑菇（这里指裸盖菇素类致幻剂），或许世界会变得更好？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:41) First of all, medical marijuana has been amazing. I’ve had friends and I’ve had others and doctors telling me that it’s been absolutely amazing.<br>(00:00:41) 首先，医用大麻的效果确实很棒。我的一些朋友、其他人，还有医生都跟我说，医用大麻的作用简直太显著了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:00:53) The list of clients that went to the island has not been made public.<br>(00:00:53) 去过那座岛（指爱泼斯坦的私人岛）的客户名单还没公开。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:00:57) Yeah, it’s very interesting, isn’t it?<br>(00:00:57) 是啊，这事儿确实很有意思，不是吗？</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:01:03) The following is a conversation with Donald Trump on this, the Lex Friedman Podcast.<br>(00:01:03) 接下来是本期《莱克斯・弗里德曼播客》中，我与唐纳德・特朗普的对话。</p>
<h2 id="Psychology-of-winning-and-losing"><a href="#Psychology-of-winning-and-losing" class="headerlink" title="Psychology of winning and losing"></a>Psychology of winning and losing</h2><h2 id="输赢心理"><a href="#输赢心理" class="headerlink" title="输赢心理"></a>输赢心理</h2><p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:01:09) They’re getting smaller and smaller.<br>(00:01:09) 他们（指对手或反对者）的声势越来越小了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:01:11) They’re getting smaller.<br>(00:01:11) 确实越来越小了。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:01:11) Right?<br>(00:01:11) 对吧？</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:01:13) People do respect you more when you have a big camera for some reason.<br>(00:01:13) 不知为何，当你身边有大型摄像机时，人们似乎会更尊重你。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:01:15) No, it’s cool. And about 20 guys that you pay a fortune to. Right?<br>(00:01:15) 也不是，其实就是场面事儿。而且还得雇大概 20 个人，花一大笔钱，不是吗？</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:01:18) All right. Okay. You said that you love winning. And you have won a lot in life, in real estate, in business, in TV and politics. So let me start with a mindset, a psychology question. What drives you more, the love of winning or the hate of losing?<br>(00:01:18) 好的。你之前说过自己热爱胜利，而且你这辈子确实赢了很多 —— 在房地产、商界、电视行业，还有政界都取得了成功。那我先从心态和心理层面问一个问题：对你来说，驱动力更强的是对胜利的热爱，还是对失败的厌恶？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:01:41) Maybe equally, maybe both. I don’t like losing and I do like winning. I’ve never thought of it as to which is more of a driving force.<br>(00:01:41) 可能两者一样强，或者说两者都很重要。我不喜欢失败，同时也热爱胜利。我从来没琢磨过哪一个驱动力更强。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:01:51) You’ve been close with a lot of the greats in sport. You think about Tiger Woods, Muhammad Ali, you have people like Michael Jordan, who I think hate losing more than anybody. So what do you learn from those guys?<br>(00:01:51) 你和很多体育界的传奇人物关系都很好，比如泰格・伍兹、穆罕默德・阿里，还有迈克尔・乔丹 —— 我觉得乔丹比任何人都更痛恨失败。你从这些人身上学到了什么？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:02:06) Well, they do have something different. The great champions have something very different, the sports champions. And you have champions in other fields, but you see it more readily in sports. You see it over a weekend or you see it during a game. And you see that certain people stand out and they keep standing out. But it’s there for you, it doesn’t take a lifetime to find out that somebody was a winner or a loser. And so the sports thing is very interesting. But I play golf with different people and there’s a different mindset among champions. There’s really a very different mindset. There’s a different thought process.<br>(00:02:06) 他们身上确实有与众不同的特质。那些伟大的冠军 —— 尤其是体育界的冠军 —— 都有着极其特别的地方。其他领域也有冠军，但体育界的冠军特质更容易被看到：可能一个周末的比赛，或者一场赛事中，你就能发现有些人脱颖而出，而且能一直保持领先。这种特质很直观，不用花一辈子时间去判断一个人是赢家还是输家。所以体育界的这些现象很有意思。我和不同的人打高尔夫，发现冠军们的心态确实不一样，真的非常不一样，他们的思维方式也截然不同。</p>
<p>(00:02:50) Talent wise, sometimes you can’t tell the difference in talent. But at the end of a weekend, they seem to win and it’s very interesting. As an example, Tiger or Jack Nicklaus, he was a phenomenal winner and he does have a different way about him and Tiger has a different way about him and Michael Jordan. There’s never one, you would think that there’d be one way. Arnold Palmer was the nicest guy you’d ever meet. And then you have some champions that aren’t really nice, they’re just focused on doing their job. So there’s not one type of person. But the one thing I would say that everybody seems to have in common is they’re very driven. They’re driven beyond.<br>(00:02:50) 单论天赋，有时候你看不出谁更胜一筹。但到了周末比赛结束时，赢的往往是他们，这一点很有意思。比如泰格（・伍兹），还有杰克・尼克劳斯 —— 尼克劳斯是个极其厉害的赢家，他身上有种独特的气质；泰格和乔丹也各有各的特质。你可能会觉得冠军都有统一的 “模板”，但其实没有。阿诺德・帕尔默（高尔夫传奇）是你能遇到的最友善的人，但有些冠军就没那么和善，他们只专注于做好自己的事。所以冠军没有固定的 “类型”，但有一点是所有人的共同点：他们都有着极强的驱动力，超乎常人的驱动力。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:03:39) They don’t seem to give up easily.<br>(00:03:39) 他们似乎都不轻易放弃。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:03:41) They don’t give up. They don’t give up, but they do seem to be, they have a passion that’s maybe more than people that don’t do as well.<br>(00:03:41) 对，他们从不放弃。而且他们身上似乎有一种热情，这种热情可能比那些成绩没那么好的人要强烈得多。</p>
<h2 id="Politics-is-a-dirty-game"><a href="#Politics-is-a-dirty-game" class="headerlink" title="Politics is a dirty game"></a>Politics is a dirty game</h2><h2 id="政治是场肮脏的游戏"><a href="#政治是场肮脏的游戏" class="headerlink" title="政治是场肮脏的游戏"></a>政治是场肮脏的游戏</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:03:51) You’ve said that politics is a dirty game-<br>(00:03:51) 你之前说过，政治是场肮脏的游戏 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:03:54) Yeah.<br>(00:03:54) 没错。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:03:54) … in the past.<br>(00:03:54) … 你以前就这么说过。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:03:56) It is a dirty game. That’s certainly true.<br>(00:03:56) 它就是场肮脏的游戏，这一点毫无疑问。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:03:59) So if it is a game, how do you win at that game?<br>(00:03:59) 那如果它是一场游戏，要怎么赢呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:04:02) Well, you win at that game by getting the word out and by using sense. You have to have a feeling where it’s going. You also have to have a feeling of what’s right. You can’t necessarily just go what’s popular, you have to do what’s good for a country if you’re talking about countries. But you have to get the word out and you have to just continuously, like for instance, you have a great show, you have a great podcast, it’s very well watched. And I’m sitting here and I do this, a lot of people see it and I do other things and a lot of people see that. And I go traditional also, you have traditional television, which is getting a little bit older and maybe less significant, could be less significant, I don’t know. But it’s changing a lot.<br>(00:04:02) 要赢，就得传播自己的主张，而且要讲道理。你得能预判趋势，还得清楚什么是对的。不能只跟风做受欢迎的事 —— 如果是关乎国家的事，就必须做对国家有利的事。但首先得让人们知道你的主张，而且要持续不断地传播。比如你这档播客就很棒，关注度很高。我现在坐在这里接受采访，很多人会看到；我做其他事，也会有很多人关注。我也会用传统媒体，比如传统电视 —— 虽然它现在受众年龄偏大，影响力可能不如以前了，不确定，但确实变化很大。</p>
<p>(00:04:48) The whole plane of platform is changing a lot. It’s changed a lot in the last two, three years. But from a political standpoint, you have to find out what people are doing, what they’re watching and you have to get on. I just see that these platforms are starting to dominate, they’re getting very big numbers. I did Spaces with Elon and they got numbers like nobody’s ever heard before. So you wouldn’t do that on radio, you wouldn’t do those numbers, no matter how good a show, you wouldn’t do those numbers on radio, you wouldn’t do on television.<br>(00:04:48) 整个平台领域的变化太大了，过去两三年里变化尤其明显。但从政治角度来说，你得知道人们在关注什么、在看什么，然后跟上这些趋势。我能看出来，这些新平台正在占据主导地位，用户量非常大。我和埃隆（・马斯克）一起做过 X 平台的 Spaces 直播，观看人数是以前从未有过的。这种数据在广播上根本不可能达到，不管节目多好，广播或电视都做不到这个量级。</p>
<h2 id="Business-vs-politics"><a href="#Business-vs-politics" class="headerlink" title="Business vs politics"></a>Business vs politics</h2><h2 id="商界与政界"><a href="#商界与政界" class="headerlink" title="商界与政界"></a>商界与政界</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:05:28) You’ve been successful in business, you’ve been successful in politics. What do you think is the difference between gaining success between the two different disparate worlds?<br>(00:05:28) 你在商界和政界都取得了成功，你觉得在这两个截然不同的领域取得成功，最大的区别是什么？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:05:37) Yeah, and they’re different, very different. I have a lot of people that are in business that are successful and they’d like to go over to politics and then you realize they can’t speak, they choke. It’s hard to make a speech in front of, let’s say you’re talking about a big audience, but I get very big audiences. And for many people it’s virtually impossible to get up and speak for an hour and a half and have nobody leave. It’s not an easy thing to do. And it’s an ability. But I have many people that are very, very successful in business, would love to do what I did. And yet, they can’t pull the trigger. And in many cases, I don’t think it would work. Almost for everybody, it’s not going to work. It’s a very tough thing to do. It’s a big transition.<br>(00:05:37) 确实，这两个领域天差地别。我认识很多商界成功人士，他们想进入政界，但最后发现自己根本不敢说话，会怯场。比如在很多人面前演讲就很难 —— 我经常面对非常庞大的听众，但对很多人来说，站起来演讲一个半小时还能让听众全程不走，几乎是不可能的事。这可不简单，是一种能力。很多商界非常成功的人，都想做我做过的事（进入政界），但他们就是不敢行动。而且很多情况下，就算行动了也不会成功，对绝大多数人来说都不会成功。这太难了，是一个巨大的转变。</p>
<p>(00:06:35) Now, if you talked about people in the business and politics going into business, likewise, that wouldn’t generally work out so well either. It’s different talents, it’s different. I have somebody that wants to go into politics so bad, but he’s got a little problem, he’s got stage fright. Now, he’s a total killer, but if he gets up onto a stage in front of people, he doesn’t do well, to put it mildly actually. He does badly.<br>(00:06:35) 反过来，政界的人想进入商界，通常也不会太顺利。因为需要的才能不一样。我认识一个人，特别想进入政界，但他有个小问题 —— 有舞台恐惧症。他在商界是个狠角色，但一上台面对人群，说得委婉点是表现不好，其实是表现得很糟糕。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:07:03) So you have to be able to make hard decisions like you do in business, but also be able to captivate an audience.<br>(00:07:03) 所以，你既要有商界那样做艰难决策的能力，还得有吸引听众的能力？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:07:09) Look, if you’re a politician, you have to be able to speak in front of large crowds. There are a lot of people who can’t do that. I’ve seen it. They can’t even think about doing it and they don’t. There are many people in business right now, I could name them, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody, they’ve been talking about running for president for 15 years. And they’re very big in business, very well known actually, but it takes guts to run. For president, I can tell you it takes guts to run. It’s also a very dangerous profession if you want to know the truth, but dangerous in a different sense too. But it takes a lot of courage to run for president. It’s not easy. But you have and you know the same people as I do, there are a lot of people that would like to run for president that are very, very successful in business, but they don’t have the guts to do it and they have to give up a lot.<br>(00:07:09) 是这样的，如果你是政客，就必须能在大批人群面前演讲。很多人做不到这一点，我见过不少。他们甚至连想都不敢想，更别说真的去做了。现在有很多商界人士 —— 我能说出他们的名字，但不想让他们难堪 ——15 年来一直说要竞选总统。他们在商界地位很高，也很有名，但竞选需要勇气。我可以告诉你，竞选总统真的需要勇气。而且说实话，这也是个危险的职业，只是危险的层面不一样。竞选总统需要极大的勇气，不容易。你也认识和我一样的人，很多商界非常成功的人都想竞选总统，但他们没那个勇气，而且竞选还需要放弃很多东西。</p>
<h2 id="War-in-Ukraine"><a href="#War-in-Ukraine" class="headerlink" title="War in Ukraine"></a>War in Ukraine</h2><h2 id="乌克兰战争"><a href="#乌克兰战争" class="headerlink" title="乌克兰战争"></a>乌克兰战争</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:08:05) One of the great things about people from the business world is they’re often great deal makers and you’re a great deal maker and you’ve talked about the war in Ukraine and that you would be able to find a deal that both Putin and Zelenskyy would accept. What do you think that deal looks like?<br>(00:08:05) 商界人士的一大优势是他们通常很会促成交易，你就是个谈判高手。你之前提到过乌克兰战争，说你能找到一个普京和泽连斯基都能接受的解决方案。你觉得这个方案会是什么样的？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:08:24) I think the deal and I wouldn’t talk about it too much because I think I can make a deal if I win as president-elect, I’ll have a deal made guaranteed. That’s a war that shouldn’t have happened. It’s terrible. Look, Biden is the worst president in the history of our country and she’s probably worse than him. That’s something that should have never happened, but it did happen. And now it’s a much tougher deal to make than it would’ve been before it started. Millions of people, I think the number’s going to be a lot higher when you see this all at some point to iron out, I think the numbers are going to be, the death numbers are going to be a lot higher than people think. When you take a look at the destruction and the buildings coming down all over the place in Ukraine, I think those numbers are going to be a lot higher.<br>(00:08:24) 这个方案嘛，我不会说太多细节，因为我相信如果我当选总统，一定能促成这个方案，这是肯定的。这场战争本不该发生，太可怕了。你看，拜登是我们国家历史上最糟糕的总统，而她（指哈里斯）可能比他还糟。这场战争本不该发生，但它还是发生了。现在要达成解决方案，比战争刚开始时难多了。伤亡人数方面，我觉得等事情尘埃落定后，真实数字会比现在人们认为的高得多。看看乌克兰各地的破坏情况，那么多建筑倒塌，死亡人数肯定比想象中多很多。</p>
<p>(00:09:12) They lie about the numbers. They try and keep them low. They knock down a building that’s two blocks long, these are big buildings and they say one person was mildly injured. No, no, a lot of people were killed. And there are people in those buildings and they have no chance. Once they start coming down, there’s no chance. So that’s a war that absolutely has to get done. And then you have Israel and then you have a lot of other places that are talking war. The world is a rough place right now and a lot of it’s because of the fact that America has no leadership. And I believe that she’ll be probably worse than Biden. I watched the interview the other night, it was just a softball interview.<br>(00:09:12) 他们在数字上撒谎，试图把伤亡人数压低。比如一栋两个街区长的大楼倒塌了 —— 那些都是很大的建筑 —— 他们却说只有一个人受了轻伤。根本不是这样，肯定有很多人丧生。大楼里有人，但大楼一倒，他们就没救了。所以这场战争必须结束。而且现在以色列（局势紧张），还有很多其他地方都有战争的苗头。现在的世界太不太平了，很大程度上是因为美国没有像样的领导力。而且我觉得她（哈里斯）可能会比拜登还糟。前几天晚上我看了她的采访，那根本就是场 “软球采访”（指提问温和、不具挑战性）。</p>
<h2 id="Kamala-Harris-interview-on-CNN"><a href="#Kamala-Harris-interview-on-CNN" class="headerlink" title="Kamala Harris interview on CNN"></a>Kamala Harris interview on CNN</h2><h2 id="卡玛拉・哈里斯的-CNN-采访"><a href="#卡玛拉・哈里斯的-CNN-采访" class="headerlink" title="卡玛拉・哈里斯的 CNN 采访"></a>卡玛拉・哈里斯的 CNN 采访</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:09:59) So you would like to see her do more interviews, challenged more.<br>(00:09:59) 所以你希望她多接受采访，而且接受更有挑战性的提问？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:10:03) I don’t know. I can’t believe the whole thing is happening. We had a man in there that should have never been in there. They kept him in a basement. They used COVID. They cheated, but they used COVID to cheat. Then they cheated without COVID too. But you had somebody in there and now we have a woman that is not, she couldn’t do an interview. This was a really soft interview. This is an interview where they’re giving her multiple choice questions, multiple guess, I call it multiple guess. And I don’t think she did well. I think she did very poorly.<br>(00:10:03) 不好说。我都不敢相信会发生这种事。我们之前有个本不该当总统的人（指拜登）在白宫，他们把他关在地下室里，还利用新冠疫情做文章。他们舞弊，而且用新冠当借口舞弊，后来没新冠了也照样舞弊。现在换成了她（哈里斯），她根本没法接受采访。之前那场采访太水了，提问都跟选择题似的，我管那叫 “猜谜式提问”。而且就算这样，她表现得也不好，非常差。</p>
<h2 id="Trump-Harris-debate"><a href="#Trump-Harris-debate" class="headerlink" title="Trump-Harris debate"></a>Trump-Harris debate</h2><h2 id="特朗普与哈里斯的辩论"><a href="#特朗普与哈里斯的辩论" class="headerlink" title="特朗普与哈里斯的辩论"></a>特朗普与哈里斯的辩论</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:10:36) How do you think you’ll do in the debate coming up, that’s in a few days?<br>(00:10:36) 几天后就要举行辩论了，你觉得自己会表现得怎么样？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:10:39) So I’ve done a lot of debating, only as a politician. I never debated. My first debate was the Rosie O’Donnell debate, the famous Rosie O’Donnell debate, the answer. But I’ve done well with debates. I became president. Then the second time, I got millions more votes than I got the first time. I was told if I got 63 million, which is what I got the first time, you would win, you can’t not when. And I got millions of more votes on that and lost by a whisker. And look what happened to the world with all of the wars and all of the problems. And look what happened with inflation because inflation is just eating up our country, eating it up. So it’s too bad. But there are a lot of things that could happen. We have to get those wars settled. I’ll tell you, you have to get Ukraine done. That could end up in a third world war. So could the Middle East. So could the Middle East.<br>(00:10:39) 我作为政客参加过很多场辩论，但以前从没辩论过。我的第一场辩论是和罗西・奥唐纳（美国主持人）的那场，就是那场很有名的辩论。但我辩论表现一直不错，不然也当不上总统。第二次竞选时，我比第一次多得了几百万票。有人告诉我，第一次我得 6300 万票就能赢，结果第二次得票更多，却以微弱差距输了。你看看现在的世界，到处都是战争和问题，通胀也快把我们国家 “吞噬” 了。太可惜了。但未来还有很多可能，我们必须解决那些战争问题。我跟你说，乌克兰问题必须解决，不然可能会引发第三次世界大战，中东问题也一样，随时可能升级。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:11:39) So maybe let’s talk about what it takes to negotiate with somebody like Putin or Zelenskyy. Do you think Putin would be willing to give up any of the regions that are already captured?<br>(00:11:39) 那我们聊聊和普京或泽连斯基这样的人谈判需要什么条件吧。你觉得普京会愿意放弃已经占领的地区吗？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:11:49) I don’t know. I can tell you that all of this would’ve never happened and it would’ve been very easy because you don’t have, that question wouldn’t be asked. That’s a tougher question. Once that starts happening because he has taken over a lot of territory, now I guess they’re insurgents now too. Right? So it’s a little bit interesting that that’s happening and that it can happen. And it’s interesting that Putin has allowed that to happen. Look, that’s one that should have never started. We have to get it stopped. Ukraine is being demolished. They’re destroying a great culture that’s largely destroyed.<br>(00:11:49) 不好说。但我可以告诉你，如果当初（拜登政府）处理得当，这一切都不会发生，问题也会很容易解决，根本不会有 “普京是否放弃占领区” 这种问题。现在问题难多了，因为他已经占领了很多领土，而且现在似乎还有叛乱分子，对吧？这种情况的发生和持续挺有意思的，普京居然允许这种情况出现。这场战争本不该开始，我们必须阻止它。乌克兰正在被摧毁，一个伟大的文化也快被彻底毁灭了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:12:32) What do you think works better in those kinds of negotiations? Leverage of let’s say friendship, the carrot or the stick, friendship or sort of the threat of using the economic and military power?<br>(00:12:32) 你觉得在这种谈判中，哪种方式更有效？是靠 “友谊” 这种筹码，还是 “胡萝卜加大棒”—— 比如靠友谊，或者靠经济、军事力量的威胁？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:12:46) So it depends on who the person is. Everyone’s different. Negotiation is interesting because it depends on who the person is. And then you have to guess or know through certain knowledge, which is more important, the carrot or the stick. And with some people, it’s the stick. And with some people, it’s the carrot. I think the stick probably is generally more successful in that we’re talking about war. But the kind of destruction that we’re witnessing now, nobody’s ever seen. It’s a terrible thing. And we’re witnessing it all over. We’re witnessing it in all parts of the world and a lot of things are going to get started. Look what’s going on with China. Look at Japan, they’re starting to rearm now. They’re starting to rearm because China’s taken over certain islands and there’s a lot of danger in the war right now, in the world.<br>(00:12:46) 这得看对方是谁，每个人都不一样。谈判的有意思之处就在于，它取决于谈判对象是谁。你得通过观察或了解，判断 “胡萝卜” 和 “大棒” 哪个更重要。对有些人来说，“大棒” 管用；对另一些人来说，“胡萝卜” 更有效。就战争谈判而言，我觉得 “大棒” 通常更有效。但我们现在看到的破坏程度，是前所未有的，太可怕了。而且这种破坏在世界各地都在发生，很多地方的局势都可能升级。你看看中国的情况，日本现在也开始重新武装了 —— 因为中国占领了某些岛屿，现在世界上的战争风险太高了。</p>
<h2 id="China"><a href="#China" class="headerlink" title="China"></a>China</h2><h2 id="中国"><a href="#中国" class="headerlink" title="中国"></a>中国</h2><p>(00:13:46) And there’s a great possibility of World War III and we better get this thing done fast because five months with people like her and him, he’s checked out, he just goes to the beach and thinks he looks good in a bathing suit, which he doesn’t, he’s sort of checked out. Hey look, you can’t blame him. That was a coup, they took it over. They took over the presidential deal. The whole presidential thing was taken over in a coup. He had 14 million votes. He had no votes, not one. And nobody thought it was going to be her. Nobody wanted it to be her. She was a joke until six weeks ago when they said we’re going to have to, politically, they felt they had to pick her. And if they didn’t pick her, they thought there would be a problem. I don’t know if that’s right or not. I actually don’t think it’s right, but they thought it was right. And now, immediately the press comes to their aid.<br>(00:13:46) 第三次世界大战的可能性很大，我们必须尽快解决这些问题，因为让她（哈里斯）和他（拜登）再执政五个月，后果不堪设想。拜登已经 “摆烂” 了，整天去海滩，还觉得自己穿泳衣好看 —— 其实一点都不好看，他就是不管事了。不过也不能全怪他，因为那场选举就是一场 “政变”，他们夺走了政权，整个总统职位都是他们通过 “政变” 抢来的。他（拜登）根本没得到那么多选票，1400 万票都是假的，他一票都没得到。而且没人想到会是她（哈里斯）接班，也没人想让她接班。六周前，她还像个笑话，后来他们（民主党）出于政治考虑，觉得必须选她，不然会出问题。我不知道他们的想法对不对，其实我觉得不对，但他们自己觉得对。现在媒体马上就站出来支持他们了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:14:48) If we can go back to China, on negotiation, how do we avoid war with China in the 21st century?<br>(00:14:48) 我们再回到中国的话题，从谈判角度来说，21 世纪我们该如何避免和中国发生战争？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:14:56) Well, there are ways. Now here’s the problem. If I tell you how and I’d love to do it, but if I give you a plan, I have a very exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia. And I have a certain idea, maybe not a plan, but an idea for China. Because we do, we’re in a lot of trouble. They’ll be in a lot of trouble too, but we’re in a lot of trouble. But I can’t give you those plans because if I give you those plans, I’m not going to be able to use them, they’ll be very unsuccessful. Part of it is surprise, right?<br>(00:14:56) 有办法的。但问题是，如果我现在告诉你方法 —— 我其实很想告诉你 —— 但如果我把方案说出来，就没法用了，肯定会失败。我有一个非常具体的方案来解决俄乌问题，对中国也有一些想法（虽然可能算不上完整方案）。因为我们现在处境很困难，中国也一样，但我们的麻烦确实很大。但我不能透露这些方案，因为一旦透露，就没法实施了。谈判的关键之一就是出其不意，对吧？</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:15:31) Right.<br>(00:15:31) 对。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:15:31) But they won’t be able to help us much.<br>(00:15:31) 而且（提前透露）对我们也没什么好处。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:15:35) So you have a plan of what to say to Putin when you take office?<br>(00:15:35) 所以你上任后，知道该跟普京说些什么？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:15:39) Yeah, I know [inaudible 00:15:40]. No, I had a very good relationship with him and I had a good relationship with Zelenskyy too, but had a very good relationship with Putin.<br>(00:15:39) 是啊，我知道该说什么 [此处音频不清晰]。而且我以前和他（普京）关系很好，和泽连斯基关系也不错，但和普京的关系确实非常好。</p>
<h2 id="2020-election"><a href="#2020-election" class="headerlink" title="2020 election"></a>2020 election</h2><h2 id="2020-年大选"><a href="#2020-年大选" class="headerlink" title="2020 年大选"></a>2020 年大选</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:15:47) Tough topic, but important. You said lost by whisker. I’m an Independent, I have a lot of friends who are Independent, many of whom like your policies, like the fact that you’re a dealmaker, like the fact that you can end wars, but they are troubled by what happened in the 2020 election and statements about widespread fraud and this kind of stuff, fake election scheme. What can you say to those Independent voters to help them decide who to vote for?<br>(00:15:47) 这是个敏感但重要的话题。你说上次是以微弱差距输了。我是无党派人士，有很多无党派的朋友，他们中很多人喜欢你的政策，认可你擅长谈判、能结束战争的能力，但他们对 2020 年大选的情况，以及你所说的 “大规模舞弊”“虚假选举阴谋” 感到不安。你想对这些无党派选民说些什么，帮助他们决定投票给谁？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:16:24) Right. I think the fraud was on the other side. I think the election was a fraud. And many people felt it was that and they wanted answers. And when you can’t challenge an election, you have to be able to challenge it, otherwise it’s going to get worse, not better. And there are lots of ways to solve this problem. Go to paper ballots. Do it easy way, I mean the paper ballots and you have voter ID and you have same day voting and you have proof of citizenship, which is very important because we have people voting that are not citizens. They just came in and they’re loading up the…<br>(00:16:24) 是这样的，我认为舞弊是对方（民主党）搞的，那场选举就是一场舞弊。很多人都这么觉得，他们想知道真相。如果选举不能被质疑，那问题只会越来越糟，不会好转。解决这个问题有很多办法，比如采用纸质选票 —— 这很简单，就是用纸质选票，同时要求选民身份证、当天投票，还要提供公民身份证明。公民身份证明很重要，因为现在有非公民在投票，他们刚入境就去投票……</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:17:00) They just came in and they’re loading up the payrolls, they’re loading up everything. They’re putting students in schools. They don’t speak a word of English, and they’re taking the seats of people that are citizens of our country. So look, we have the worst border in the history of the world. We have coming into our country right now, millions and millions of people at levels that nobody’s ever seen. I don’t believe any country’s ever seen it. And they would use sticks and stones not to make it happen, not to let it happen. We don’t do anything. And we have a person who was the border czar, who now said she wasn’t really the border czar, but she was, she was the border czar, but she was in charge of the border. And we have her and she’s saying very strongly, “Oh, I did such a good job.” She was horrible, horrible. The harm she’s done…<br>(00:17:00) … 他们刚入境，就占用我们的福利资源，占用各种资源，还把孩子送进学校 —— 这些孩子连一句英语都不会说，却占了我们本国公民孩子的学位。你看，我们现在的边境是历史上最糟糕的，每天有数百万人涌入，规模前所未有，我觉得没有任何一个国家经历过这种情况。换作其他国家，肯定会想尽办法阻止，但我们什么都不做。之前有个 “边境沙皇”（负责边境事务的官员），现在她却说自己不是真的 “边境沙皇”，但她明明就是，她负责边境事务，现在还大言不惭地说 “我做得很好”。她做得糟透了，太糟糕了，她造成的危害……</p>
<p>(00:17:56) But we have people coming in from other countries all over the world, not just South America, and they’re coming in from prisons and jails. They’re coming in from mental institutions and insane asylums and they’re street criminals right off the street. They take them and they’re being given to our country, drug dealers, human traffickers. We’re destroying our country. This is a sin what’s been allowed to take place over the last four years. We’re our country. And we’ll see how that all works out, but it’s not even believable. And now you see, you saw in Aurora, Colorado, a group of very tough young thugs from Venezuela taking over big areas including buildings. They’re taking over buildings. They have their big rifles, but they’re taking over buildings.<br>(00:17:56) 而且涌入的人来自世界各地，不只是南美 —— 他们中有监狱里出来的囚犯、精神病院的病人，还有街头混混。他们（其他国家）把这些人送到我们国家，还有毒贩、人贩子。我们的国家正在被摧毁，过去四年发生的这些事简直是罪过。我们的国家啊…… 不知道最后会怎样，但这一切太离谱了。你看科罗拉多州奥罗拉市，一群来自委内瑞拉的凶狠年轻暴徒占领了大片区域，包括一些建筑。他们拿着大口径步枪，就这么占领了建筑。</p>
<p>(00:18:52) We’re not going to let this happen. We’re not going to let them destroy a country. And in those countries,, crime is way down, they’re taking them out of their prisons, which is good because good for them. I do the same thing. By the way, if I ran one of those countries, any country in the world, I would make sure that America has every one of our prisoners, every one of our criminals would be here. I can’t believe they’re going so slowly, but some are. But they all are doing it and we can’t let that happen. They’re emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States of America. We can’t let that happen.<br>(00:18:52) 我们不会让这种事继续下去，不会让他们摧毁我们的国家。那些国家把囚犯送走后，犯罪率大幅下降，对他们来说当然是好事。换作我，如果我是某个国家的领导人，我肯定也会把所有囚犯、罪犯都送到美国来。真不敢相信他们动作这么慢，但确实有国家在这么做，而且所有国家都在这么做，我们不能让这种事发生。他们把监狱和精神病院的人都清空，送到美国来，我们绝不能容忍。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:19:29) So a lot of people believe that there was some shady stuff that went on with the election, whether it’s media bias or big tech, but still the claim of widespread fraud is the thing that bothers people.<br>(00:19:29) 很多人认为选举中确实有猫腻，比如媒体偏见、大型科技公司干预，但 “大规模舞弊” 这种说法还是让很多人不安。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:19:42) Well, I don’t focus on the past. I focus on the future. I mean, I talk about how bad the economy is, how bad inflation is now, bad things like… Which is important. Afghanistan was, in my opinion, the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to our country. And because of that, I think Putin went in when he said how stupid we were. Putin went in, but it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. I really believe that. But we left 13 dead soldiers, think of it, 13 dead soldiers, many soldiers horrifically hurt, with arms and legs and everything else gone. We left hostages behind. We left Americans behind. We left military equipment, the likes of which nobody’s ever left behind before. Billions and billions of dollars of equipment. They’re now selling the equipment. They’re one of the largest arms dealers in the world.<br>(00:19:42) 我其实不怎么关注过去，我更关注未来。我会说现在经济多糟、通胀多严重，这些才是重要的事。在我看来，阿富汗撤军是我们国家历史上最丢人的事。正因为我们撤军那么狼狈，普京才会说 “美国人真蠢”，然后趁机行动（指进攻乌克兰）。那真的是我们国家历史上最丢人的时刻，我对此深信不疑。我们留下了 13 名阵亡士兵 —— 想想看，13 个人，还有很多士兵受了重伤，缺胳膊少腿。我们还留下了人质、美国公民，还有价值数十亿美元的军事装备，规模前所未有。现在塔利班在卖这些装备，他们都成了世界上最大的军火商之一。</p>
<p>(00:20:45) And very sad, very sad. And we were there for a long time. I was going to get out. We were getting ready to get out. Then we got interrupted by the election, but we would’ve been out with dignity and strength. We were having very little problem with the Taliban when I was there, because they knew it was going to be tough. I dealt with Abdul. Abdul was the leader, and we got along fine. He understood, but they were shooting, they were killing a lot of our people before I came down. And when I got there, I spoke to him, I said, “You can’t do it. Don’t do it anymore.” We went 18 months before this happened, this horrible day happened. We went 18 months and nobody was shot at or killed.<br>(00:20:45) 太令人难过了。我们在阿富汗待了那么久，我本来计划体面撤军，当时已经在准备了，结果被选举打断了。如果是我，我们会带着尊严和实力撤军。我执政时，我们和塔利班几乎没什么冲突，因为他们知道我不好惹。我和阿卜杜勒（塔利班领导人）打过交道，我们关系还不错，他明白我的意思。但在我上任前，塔利班经常开枪，杀了我们很多人。我上任后跟他说：“你不能再这么做了，别再这么干了。” 在那场可怕的撤军事件发生前，我们有 18 个月没有一名士兵遭到枪击或阵亡。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:21:33) What do you think that was? The carrot or the stick, in that case, in Afghanistan?<br>(00:21:33) 你觉得那时候在阿富汗，是 “胡萝卜” 还是 “大棒” 起了作用？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:21:37) The stick, definitely the stick.<br>(00:21:37) 肯定是 “大棒”。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:21:38) So the threat of military force.<br>(00:21:38) 也就是军事力量的威胁？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:21:40) That was the stick, yeah. It doesn’t have to be, but that was the stick.<br>(00:21:40) 对，就是 “大棒”。不一定非要用这个，但当时确实是靠这个。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:21:44) Well, let me just linger on the election a little bit more. For this election, it might be a close one. What can we do to avoid the insanity and division of the previous election, whether you win or lose?<br>(00:21:44) 那我再多问一点关于选举的事。这次选举可能会很胶着，不管你赢还是输，我们该怎么做才能避免上次选举那种混乱和分裂？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:21:58) Well, I hope it’s not a close one. I mean, I don’t know how people can vote for somebody that has destroyed our country, the inflation, the bad economy. But to me, in a way, the worst is what they’ve allowed to happen at our border where they’ve allowed millions of people to come and hear from places that you don’t want to know about. And I can’t believe that there’s going to be a close election. We’re leading in the polls and it looks close, but I think in the end it’s not going to be a close election.<br>(00:21:58) 我希望不会胶着。我真的不明白，怎么会有人投票给那个摧毁了我们国家的人（指拜登）—— 看看通胀、看看糟糕的经济。而且对我来说，最糟糕的是他们放任边境失控，让数百万来自不明地方的人涌入。我真不敢相信这次选举会胶着，我们在民调中领先，虽然看起来接近，但我觉得最后不会胶着。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:22:29) What do you think is the right way to solve the immigration crisis? Is mass deportation one of the solutions you would think about?<br>(00:22:29) 你觉得解决移民危机的正确方法是什么？大规模驱逐非法移民是你会考虑的方案之一吗？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:22:35) Well, you’ve got to get the criminals out of here fast, right? The people from mental institutions, you got to get them back into their mental institution. No country can afford this. It’s just too much money. You look at what’s happening in New York and Chicago and LA and lots of places, and you take a look at what’s happening. There’s no country can afford this. We can’t afford it, and we’ve got to get the bad ones out immediately and the rest have to be worked on. It’s happened before. Dwight Eisenhower was sort of a moderate president, moderate type person, but he hated when he saw people pouring into the country, and they were nothing like. Now, I probably got elected in 2016, because of the border, and I told people what was happening and they understood it. And I won the election.<br>(00:22:35) 首先，必须尽快把罪犯驱逐出去，对吧？还有那些从精神病院出来的人，得把他们送回精神病院。没有哪个国家能承受这种情况，太费钱了。你看看纽约、芝加哥、洛杉矶这些地方的情况，没有哪个国家能扛得住。我们也扛不住，所以必须立刻把坏人赶走，其他人的问题再慢慢解决。以前也有过类似情况，德怀特・艾森豪威尔（美国前总统）算是温和派，但他看到有人涌入美国就很反感，而且那时候的移民规模根本没法和现在比。2016 年我能当选，很可能就是因为边境问题 —— 我告诉人们边境的真实情况，他们理解了，然后选了我。</p>
<p>(00:23:25) And I won the election, I think because of the border. Our border is 25 times worse right now than it was in 2016. I had it fixed too. I had it the last week of the famous chart that I put up was exactly that, you know the chart. When I looked to the right, I said, “There’s the chart.” Bing. That was not a pleasant experience, but the chart that I put up said, and that was done by border patrol. That was the lowest number that we’ve ever had come into our country in recorded history and we have to get it back to that again. We will.<br>(00:23:25) 我觉得 2016 年当选就是因为边境问题。现在的边境情况比 2016 年糟 25 倍，但我以前已经把边境问题解决了。我执政最后一周公布的那张著名图表 —— 你应该见过 —— 就是证明。那张图表是边境巡逻队做的，显示当时的非法移民数量是有记录以来最低的。我们必须再回到那个水平，而且我们一定能做到。</p>
<h2 id="Project-2025"><a href="#Project-2025" class="headerlink" title="Project 2025"></a>Project 2025</h2><h2 id="2025-计划"><a href="#2025-计划" class="headerlink" title="2025 计划"></a>2025 计划</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:24:04) Let me ask you about Project 2025. So you’ve publicly said that you don’t have any direct connection to-<br>(00:24:04) 我想问问关于 “2025 计划” 的事。你之前公开说过，你和这个计划没有直接关联 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:24:09) Nothing. I know nothing about it. And they know that too. Democrats know that. And I purposely haven’t read it, because I want to say to you, I have no idea what it’s all about. It’s easier, than saying I read it and all of the things. No, I purposely haven’t read it and I’ve heard about it. I’ve heard about things that are in there that I don’t like, and there’s some things in there that everybody would like, but there are things that I don’t like at all. And I think it’s unfortunate that they put it out, but it doesn’t mean anything, because it has nothing to do with me. Project 25 has absolutely nothing to do with me.<br>(00:24:09) 一点关系都没有，我对此一无所知。民主党人也知道这一点。我故意没去看这个计划，就是为了能坦诚地说 “我完全不知道这是怎么回事”。说 “没看过” 比说 “看过但不认同某些内容” 简单多了。我确实没看，只是听说过一些。听说里面有些内容我不喜欢，也有些内容大家可能会喜欢，但确实有很多我完全不认同的东西。他们公布这个计划挺可惜的，但这和我没关系，“2025 计划” 和我一点关系都没有。</p>
<h2 id="Marijuana"><a href="#Marijuana" class="headerlink" title="Marijuana"></a>Marijuana</h2><h2 id="大麻"><a href="#大麻" class="headerlink" title="大麻"></a>大麻</h2><p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:24:52) You posted recently about marijuana and that you are okay with it being legalized, but it has to be done safely. Can you explain your policy there?<br>(00:24:52) 你最近发文谈到大麻，说你支持大麻合法化，但必须以安全的方式推进。能说说你的具体政策想法吗？</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:25:03) Well, I just put out a paper and first of all, medical marijuana has been amazing. I’ve had friends and I’ve had others and doctors telling me that it’s been absolutely amazing, the medical marijuana. And we put out a statement that we can live with the marijuana. It’s got to be a certain age, got to be a certain age to buy it. It’s got to be done in a very concerted, lawful way. And the way they’re doing in Florida, I think is going to be actually good. It’s going to be very good, but it’s got to be done in a good way. It’s got to be done in a clean way. You go into some of these places, like in New York, it smells all marijuana. You’ve got to have a system where there’s control. And I think the way they’ve done it in Florida is very good.<br>(00:25:03) 我最近刚发布了一份文件，首先，医用大麻的效果非常好。我的朋友、其他人还有医生都跟我说，医用大麻的作用简直太棒了。我们已经发表声明，支持大麻相关政策，但必须有年龄限制 —— 购买大麻得达到一定年龄，而且必须以协调、合法的方式推进。佛罗里达州的做法我觉得很好，会很有效，但关键是要规范、有序。比如在纽约，有些地方到处都是大麻味，这就不行，必须有管控机制。佛罗里达的管控方式就很好。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman<br>莱克斯・弗里德曼<br>(00:25:59) Do you know anything about psychedelics? So I’m not a drug guy, but I recently did Ayahuasca and there’s a lot of people that speak to the health benefits and the spiritual benefits of these different psychedelics. I think we would probably have a better world if everybody in Congress took some mushrooms perhaps. Now I know you don’t. You stay away from all of that stuff. I know also veterans use it for dealing with PTSD and all that kind of stuff. So it’s great. And it’s interesting that you’re thinking about being more accepting of some of these drugs, which don’t just have a recreational purpose, but a medical purpose, a treatment purpose.<br>(00:25:59) 你了解致幻剂吗？我不是 “瘾君子”，但最近尝试了死藤水（Ayahuasca）。很多人说不同的致幻剂对健康和精神有好处，我甚至觉得，如果国会议员都吃点致幻蘑菇（裸盖菇素），世界可能会更好。我知道你不会碰这些东西，一直远离它们。我也知道退伍军人用致幻剂治疗创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）之类的问题，效果很好。你现在对这类药物（不仅有娱乐用途，还有医疗、治疗用途）持更开放的态度，这挺有意思的。</p>
<p>Donald Trump<br>唐纳德・特朗普<br>(00:26:44) So we put out a statement today, we’re going to put out another one probably next week, be more specific, although I think it’s pretty specific and we’ll see how that all goes. That’s a referendum coming up in some states, but it’s coming up and we’ll see how it does. I will say it’s been very hard to beat it. You take a look at the numbers, it’s been very hard to beat it. So I think it’ll generally pass, but you want to do it in a safe way.<br>(00:26:44) 我们今天刚发表了一份声明，下周可能还会再发一份更具体的 —— 虽然现在这份已经挺具体了，看看后续情况吧。有些州会就这个问题举行公投，快开始了，看看结果如何。我得说，支持这类药物合法化的声音很难被反驳，从数据来看，反对的声音越来越弱，所以我觉得公投可能会通过，但关键还是要以安全的方式推进。</p>
<h2 id="Joe-Rogan"><a href="#Joe-Rogan" class="headerlink" title="Joe Rogan"></a>Joe Rogan</h2><h2 id="乔・罗根"><a href="#乔・罗根" class="headerlink" title="乔・罗根"></a>乔・罗根</h2><p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:27:14) Speaking of marijuana, let me ask you about my good friend, Joe Rogan. So you had a bit of tension with him. So when he said nice things about RFK Junior, I think you’ve said some not so nice things about Joe, and I think that was a bit unfair. And as a fan of Joe, I would love to see you do his podcast, because he is legit the greatest conversationalist in the world. So what’s the story behind the tension?<br>(00:27:14) 说到大麻，我想问问关于我的好朋友乔・罗根的事。你和他之间似乎有点矛盾。之前他称赞小罗伯特・肯尼迪（RFK Junior）时，我记得你对乔说过一些不太友好的话，我觉得那样有点不公平。作为乔的粉丝，我很希望看到你去参加他的播客节目，因为他确实是世界上最厉害的对话者。所以，你们之间的矛盾到底是怎么回事呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:27:42) Well, I don’t think there was any tension. And I’ve always liked him, but I don’t know him. I only see him when I walk into the arena with Dana and I shake his hand. I see him there and I think he’s good at what he does, but I don’t know about doing his podcast. I guess I’d do it, but I haven’t been asked and I’m not asking them. I’m not asking anybody.<br>(00:27:42) 嗯，我觉得根本没什么矛盾。我一直挺欣赏他的，但我并不了解他。我只在和达纳走进竞技场的时候见过他，跟他握过手。我觉得他很擅长自己的工作，但至于要不要去他的播客节目，我还不确定。如果邀请我，我或许会去，但目前没人邀请我，我也不会主动去求他们 —— 我不会求任何人。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:28:09) It sounds like a challenging negotiation situation.<br>(00:28:09) 这听起来像是个棘手的谈判局面啊。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:28:11) No, it’s not really a negotiation. And he’s sort of a liberal guy, I guess, from what I understand. But he likes Kennedy. This was before I found this out, before Kennedy came in with us. He’s going to be great. Bobby’s going to be great. But I like that he likes Kennedy. I do too. He is a different kind of a guy, but he’s got some great things going. And I think he’s going to be beyond politics. I think he could be quite influential and taking care of some situations that you probably would agree should be taken care of.<br>(00:28:11) 不，这算不上什么谈判。据我所知，他大概是个自由派人士。但他很欣赏肯尼迪，我是后来才知道这件事的，那时候肯尼迪还没和我们站在一起。肯尼迪会很出色的，鲍比（肯尼迪的昵称）会很厉害。不过我挺认可他欣赏肯尼迪这一点 —— 我也很欣赏肯尼迪。肯尼迪是个与众不同的人，而且他正在做一些很棒的事。我觉得他的影响力会超越政治领域，他或许能在一些你也认为需要解决的问题上发挥重要作用。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:28:45) The Joe Rogan post is an example. I would love to get your psychology about behind the tweets and the post on truth. Are you sometimes being intentionally provocative or are you just speaking your mind and are there times where you regret some of the truths you’ve posted?<br>(00:28:45) 乔・罗根的帖子就是个例子。我很想了解你发推文和在 “Truth” 平台发帖时的想法 —— 你有时候是故意挑衅，还是只是在说出自己的真实想法？有没有过后悔自己发过的帖子的时候？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:29:04) Yeah, I do, but not that often, honestly. I do a lot of re-posting. The ones you get in trouble with are the re-posts, because you find down deep, they’re into some group that you’re not supposed to be re-posting. You don’t even know if those groups are good, bad or indifferent. But the re-posts are the ones that really get you in trouble. When you do your own words, it’s sort of easier. But the re-posts go very, and if you’re going to check every single little symbol, and I don’t know, it’s worked out pretty well for me. I mean, I tell you, truth is very powerful, truth. And it’s my platform and it’s been very powerful, very, very powerful. Goes everywhere. I call it my typewriter. That’s actually my typewriter.<br>(00:29:04) 有过，但说实话，不常后悔。我转发过很多内容，而惹麻烦的往往就是转发 —— 因为到最后你会发现，那些内容可能来自一些你本不该转发的团体。你甚至不知道那些团体是好是坏，或者无关紧要。但转发确实很容易让你陷入麻烦，相比之下，发自己写的内容就简单多了。不过转发的传播力很强，而且要是逐字逐句检查每个细节，也不太现实。但总的来说，这个平台对我来说效果很好。我跟你说，“Truth” 这个平台非常强大，它是我的平台，影响力大得很，真的非常大，内容一发出去就能传遍各地。我把它称作我的 “打字机”，它确实就像我的打字机一样。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:29:54) What are you doing usually when you’re composing a truth, are you chilling back on a couch?<br>(00:29:54) 你写 “Truth” 帖子的时候，通常在做什么？是躺在沙发上放松的时候写吗？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:30:00) Couches, beds.<br>(00:30:00) 沙发上、床上都有可能。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:30:01) Okay.<br>(00:30:01) 好的。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:30:02) A lot of different things. I mean-<br>(00:30:02) 很多时候是在不同的状态下写的。我是说 ——</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:30:03) Late at night and just-<br>(00:30:03) 比如深夜的时候，就只是 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:30:06) I’d like to do something late at night. I’m not a huge sleeper, but whenever I do, I’m past three o’clock, they criticize you the next day. Trump was up. True thing. Okay. Trump was true thing at three o’clock in the morning and there should be no problem with that. And then when you think about time zones, how do they know that you are in a time zone, like an Eastern Zone, but every time I do it after 2:00 or three o’clock, it’s like, “Why is he doing that?” But it’s gotten… Truth has become a very successful platform, and I like doing it and it goes everywhere. As soon as I do it, it goes everywhere.<br>(00:30:06) 我喜欢在深夜发内容。我不是很能睡的人，但每次过了凌晨三点发，第二天就会有人批评我，说 “特朗普又熬夜了”。但这有什么问题呢？而且考虑到时区，他们怎么知道我在哪个时区？比如我在东部时区，但每次我两点或三点以后发，总有人问 “他为什么要这么做？” 不过现在也无所谓了……“Truth” 已经成了一个非常成功的平台，我喜欢在上面发内容，而且内容一出去就能传遍各地，我一发，马上就扩散开了。</p>
<h2 id="Division"><a href="#Division" class="headerlink" title="Division"></a>Division</h2><h2 id="社会分裂"><a href="#社会分裂" class="headerlink" title="社会分裂"></a>社会分裂</h2><p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:30:54) The country seems more divided than ever. What can you do to help alleviate some of that division?<br>(00:30:54) 现在这个国家似乎比以往任何时候都更分裂。你能做些什么来缓解这种分裂呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:30:59) Well, you can get rid of these two people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible. You don’t want to have them running this country. They’re not equipped to run it. Joe, just Joe, it’s a disaster. And Kamala, I think she’ll end up being worse than him. We’ll see. I think a lot’s now, the convention’s over with, and I see I’m leading and just about all the polls now. They had their little honeymoon period as they call it, and we’ll see how that all goes. Who knows?<br>(00:30:59) 嗯，首先得把那两个人换掉。他们太糟糕了，真的太糟糕了。你不会希望让他们来管理这个国家的，他们根本没能力胜任。乔（拜登）一个人就已经是场灾难了，而卡玛拉（哈里斯），我觉得她最后会比他更糟。咱们走着瞧。现在党代会已经结束了，我看几乎所有民调里我都领先。他们所谓的 “蜜月期” 已经过了，接下来会怎么样，谁也说不准。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:31:31) From my personal opinion, I think you are at your best when you’re talking about a positive vision of the future versus criticizing the other side.<br>(00:31:31) 以我个人的看法，我觉得你谈论对未来的积极愿景时，比批评对手时更有说服力。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:31:40) Yeah, I think you have to criticize though. I think they’re nasty. They came up with a story that I looked down and I called soldiers that died in World War I, suckers and losers. Okay. Now number one, who would say that? Number two, who would say it to military people? Nobody. It was a made-up story. It was just a made-up story. And they like to repeat it over again. They know it was made up. I have 26 witnesses that nothing was said. They don’t want to hear about that. She lied on McDonald’s. She said that she worked at McDonald’s. It’s not a big lie, but it’s a big lie. So they just went and they checked and unless she can show something, they don’t talk about the presses are going to follow up with it, but I’ll keep hammering it. But she never worked at McDonald’s. It was just sort of a cool thing to say, “Hey, I worked at McDonald’s.”<br>(00:31:40) 话是这么说，但我觉得批评是必要的，因为他们太恶劣了。他们编造谣言说，我看不起一战中阵亡的士兵，还称他们是 “蠢货” 和 “失败者”。你想想，首先，谁会说这种话？其次，谁会对军人说这种话？根本没人会这么做。这完全是捏造的故事，他们就是故意反复传播。他们明明知道这是假的，我有 26 个证人可以证明我从没说过那种话，但他们根本不想听。还有卡玛拉，她在麦当劳工作的事上撒谎了 —— 她说自己曾在麦当劳工作过。这或许不算什么大谎言，但性质很恶劣。他们去查证过了，除非她能拿出证据，否则这事就不了了之了，但我会一直追究下去。她根本没在麦当劳工作过，她说那句话只是为了显得 “接地气”，就像在说 “嘿，我也在麦当劳打过工呢”。</p>
<p>(00:32:41) But one of the worst was two days ago. I went to Arlington at the request of people that lost their children. They’ll always be children to those people. You understand that. That’s not politically incorrect thing to say. The mother comes up, “I lost my child,” but the child is a soldier. And lost the child, because of Biden and because of Kamala, just as though they had the gun in their hand, because it was so badly handled. It should have been done at Bagram, which is the big air base. It shouldn’t have been done at a small little airport right in the middle of town where people stormed it. It was a true disaster and they asked me if I’d come and celebrate with them. Three years. Three years. They died three years ago.<br>(00:32:41) 但最过分的是两天前的事。我应一些失去孩子的家庭的邀请去了阿灵顿国家公墓。对这些家庭来说，他们的孩子永远是孩子，你能理解吧？这么说并不是政治不正确。有位母亲过来对我说 “我失去了我的孩子”，而她的孩子是一名士兵。这些孩子之所以牺牲，都是因为拜登和卡玛拉 —— 就像他们亲手扣动了扳机一样，因为他们把事情办得一塌糊涂。撤军本应该在巴格拉姆那个大型空军基地进行，而不是在市中心的一个小机场，结果那里遭到了袭击，简直是一场灾难。这些家庭邀请我去参加纪念活动，因为他们的孩子已经牺牲三年了，整整三年啊。</p>
<p>(00:33:37) And I said, “I’m going to try.” I got to know them, because I brought them here, actually. One night they almost all came here and they said, “I wonder if Trump will actually come and see us?” I heard they were here. I came. We stayed for four hours listening to music up on a deck, right upstairs. Beautiful. And they were great people. So they called me over the last couple of weeks and they said, “We’re going to have a reunion, our three-year reunion.”<br>(00:33:37) 我对他们说 “我会尽量去”。其实我早就认识这些家庭了，因为是我把他们邀请到这里来的。有天晚上他们几乎都来了，还在议论 “不知道特朗普会不会真的来见我们”。我听说他们来了，就过去和他们见面。我们在楼上的露台上听了四个小时的音乐，那场面很温馨，他们都是很好的人。所以过去几周他们给我打电话，说 “我们要办一个团聚活动，纪念孩子牺牲三周年”。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:34:00) … couple of weeks and they said, “We’re going to have a reunion, our three year, would you be able to come?” And it was very hard for me to do it logistically, but I said, “I’ll get it done.” And I got there and we had a beautiful time. I didn’t run away. I didn’t just walk in, shake hands and walk out like people do. And I wasn’t looking at my watch like Joe Biden does. And it was amazing. I did it for them. I didn’t do it for me. I don’t need the publicity. I get more publicity probably than anybody. You would know that better than me, but I think maybe more than anybody, maybe more than anybody that’s ever lived, I don’t know. But I don’t think anyone could have anymore. Every time you turn on the television, there’s like nine different stories all on different topics in the world.<br>(00:34:00) …… 几周前他们打电话说 “我们要办三周年团聚活动，你能来吗？” 从行程安排上来说，我去参加其实很困难，但我还是说 “我会想办法去”。最后我去了，和他们度过了一段很愉快的时光。我没有敷衍了事，没有像有些人那样进去握个手就走，也没有像乔・拜登那样一直看手表。那感觉很棒，我是为他们去的，不是为了自己。我不需要靠这个博眼球，我的曝光度可能比任何人都高。这一点你或许比我更清楚，我甚至觉得我的曝光度可能比有史以来任何人都高 —— 我也不确定，但肯定没人能比我更高了。你每次打开电视，几乎都能看到九个不同的新闻，全是关于我的各种话题。</p>
<p>(00:34:48) As an example, you interview a lot of people, good people, successful people. Let’s see how you do with this interview versus them. I can tell you right now you’re going to get the highest numbers you’ve ever had by sometimes a factor of 10. But when a Gold Star Family asks me to come in and spend time with them, and then they said, sir… We did a ceremony. And then we went down to the graves, which was quite a distance away. They said, “Sir, would you come to the grave?” And then they said, when we were there… It’s very sad actually because these people shouldn’t have died. They shouldn’t have died. They died because of Biden and because of Kamala, they died because just like if they pulled the trigger. Now, I don’t know if that’s controversial to say, but I don’t think it is.<br>(00:34:48) 举个例子，你采访过很多人，都是优秀的、成功的人。咱们可以看看这次采访和你之前的采访相比，数据会怎么样。我现在就能告诉你，这次采访的观看量会是你有史以来最高的，有时候甚至能达到十倍。但当金星家庭（美国对牺牲军人家庭的称呼）邀请我去陪伴他们时，我还是去了。我们举行了纪念仪式，然后去了墓地 —— 离得还挺远。他们说 “先生，您能去墓前看看吗？” 我们到了那里之后…… 其实真的很令人难过，因为这些人本不该死的。他们不该死，他们的牺牲都是拜拜登和卡玛拉所赐，就像他们亲手杀了这些士兵一样。我不知道这么说会不会有争议，但我觉得没有。</p>
<p>(00:35:47) Afghanistan was the most incompetently run operation I think I’ve ever seen. Military or otherwise, they’re incompetent. But the families asked me if I’d go, I did go. Then the families said, “Could we have a picture at the tombstone of my son?” And we did. Son or daughter. There was a daughter too. And I took numerous pictures with the families. I don’t know of anybody else that was in the pictures, but they were mostly families, I guess. That was it. And then I left. I spent a lot of time with them. Then I left and I get home that night and I get a call that the Biden administration with Kamala is accusing me of using Arlington for publicity. I was in the news. Just the opposite. Just the opposite. And actually, did you see, it just came out? The families actually put out a very strong statement defending me. They said, “We asked them to be there.”<br>(00:35:47) 阿富汗撤军是我见过的最无能的行动，不管是从军事角度还是其他角度看，他们（拜登政府）都太无能了。但既然那些家庭邀请我，我就去了。之后他们说 “能和我儿子的墓碑合张影吗？” 我就和他们拍了照 —— 有儿子也有女儿，其中还有一个牺牲的女兵。我和这些家庭拍了很多照片，照片里应该只有他们家人，我猜是这样。之后我就离开了，我陪了他们很久。结果那天晚上我回到家，就接到电话说，拜登政府和卡玛拉在指责我利用阿灵顿公墓博眼球。这简直是颠倒黑白，完全是反过来的。而且你看到了吗？刚出的消息 —— 那些家庭其实发了一份措辞强烈的声明为我辩护，他们说 “是我们邀请他去的”。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:36:44) Well, politicians and the media can play those games. And you’re right, your name gets a lot of views. You’re probably legit the most famous person in the world. But on the previous thing, in the spirit of unity, you used to be a Democrat. Setting the politicians aside, what do you respect most about people who lean left, who are Democrats themselves or of that persuasion, progressives liberals, and so on?<br>(00:36:44) 唉，政客和媒体就是会搞这种把戏。而且你说得对，你的名字自带很高的关注度，你或许真的是世界上最有名的人。但回到之前的话题，从团结的角度来说，你以前是民主党人。抛开政客不谈，对于那些左倾人士、民主党人，或者持进步主义、自由主义立场的人，你最尊重他们哪一点呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:37:15) Well, look, I respect the fact that everybody’s in there, and to a certain extent, life is what you do while you’re waiting to die, so you might as well do a good job. I think in terms of what’s happening now, I think we have a chance to save the country. This country’s going down and I called it with Venezuela, I called it with a lot of different countries. And this country’s going down if we don’t win this election, the election coming up on November 5th is the most important election this country’s ever had because if we don’t win it, I don’t know that there’ll be another election and it’s going to be a communist country or close.<br>(00:37:15) 嗯，是这样，我尊重每个人都有自己的立场这一点。而且在某种程度上，人生就是在等待死亡的过程中做些事，所以不如把事做好。但就目前的情况来看，我认为我们还有机会拯救这个国家。这个国家正在走下坡路，我之前说过委内瑞拉会这样，也说过很多其他国家会这样，现在美国也一样。如果我们赢不了这次选举，这个国家就完了。11 月 5 日的这次选举是美国有史以来最重要的一次选举，因为如果我们输了，我不知道还会不会有下一次选举，这个国家可能会变成一个共产主义国家，或者接近共产主义国家。</p>

<p>(00:38:01) There’s a lot of people listening to this, myself included, that doesn’t think that Kamala is a communist.<br>(00:38:01) 现在有很多人在听这次采访，包括我在内，都不认为卡玛拉是共产主义者。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:38:09) Well, she’s a Marxist.<br>(00:38:09) 好吧，那她是个马克思主义者。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:38:11) Her father’s a Marxist.<br>(00:38:11) 她父亲是马克思主义者。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:38:12) That’s right.<br>(00:38:12) 没错。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:38:13) And she’s advocating-<br>(00:38:13) 而且她在倡导 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:38:13) That’s a little unusual.<br>(00:38:13) 这就有点不寻常了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:38:15) She’s advocating for some policies that are towards the direction of democratic socialism, let’s say. But there’s a lot of people that know the way government works and they say, well, none of those policies are going to actually come to reality. It’s just being used during the campaign to… Groceries are too expensive. We need them cheaper, so let’s talk about price controls. And that’s never going to come to reality.<br>(00:38:15) 这么说吧，她在倡导一些朝着民主社会主义方向的政策。但很多了解政府运作方式的人都说，这些政策根本不可能实现，只是竞选期间用来拉选票的 —— 比如食品价格太贵，大家希望降价，所以就提价格管制，但这根本不可能实现。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:38:39) It could come to reality. Look, she came out with price control. It’s been tried like 121 different times at different places over the years, and it’s never worked once. It leads to communism, it leads to socialism, it leads to having no food on the shelves, and it leads to tremendous inflation.<br>(00:38:39) 它有可能实现。你看，她都明确提出价格管制了。这么多年来，世界各地尝试过 121 次价格管制，没有一次成功的。这会导致共产主义，导致社会主义，会让货架上空空如也，还会引发严重的通货膨胀。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:39:00) It’s just-<br>(00:39:00) 只是 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:39:01) A bad idea.<br>(00:39:01) 这是个糟糕的主意。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:39:02) … whenever we use terms like communism for her, and I don’t know if you know this, but some people call you a fascist.<br>(00:39:02) …… 但当我们用 “共产主义者” 这样的词形容她时，不知道你有没有意识到，也有人称你为 “法西斯主义者”。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:39:08) Yeah, they do, so I figure it’s all right to call them a communist. They call me a lot worse than I call them.<br>(00:39:08) 是啊，他们是这么叫我，所以我觉得我称他们为共产主义者也没什么问题。他们对我的称呼比我对他们的难听多了。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:39:14) They do indeed. It is just sometimes-<br>(00:39:14) 确实是这样。只是有时候 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:39:16) It’s interesting though, they’ll call me something that’s terrible and then I’ll hit them back and they’ll say, “Isn’t it terrible what Trump said?” I said, “Well, wait a minute. They just called me…” I believe you have to fight fire with fire. I believe they’re very evil people. These are evil people. We have an enemy from the outside and we have an enemy from within. And in my opinion, the enemy from within are radical left lunatics. And I think you have to fight back.<br>(00:39:16) 但有意思的是，他们先用很难听的词骂我，我反击之后，他们又说 “特朗普说的话多难听啊”。我就会说 “等等，是他们先这么骂我的……” 我认为必须以牙还牙。他们是很邪恶的人，真的很邪恶。我们有外部敌人，也有内部敌人，在我看来，内部敌人就是那些激进的左翼疯子，必须反击他们。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:39:44) Whenever there’s a lot of fighting fire with fire, it’s too easy to forget that there is a middle of America that’s moderate and sees the good in both sides and just likes one side more than the other in terms of policies. Like I said, there’s a lot of people that like your policies, that like your skill in being able to negotiate and end wars and they don’t see the impending destruction of America.<br>(00:39:44) 但当大家都在以牙还牙的时候，很容易忘记美国还有很多温和的中间派 —— 他们能看到两派的优点，只是在政策层面更倾向于其中一方。就像我之前说的，很多人喜欢你的政策，欣赏你谈判和结束战争的能力，而且他们并不认为美国正面临即将到来的毁灭。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:40:15) We had no wars when I was president. That’s a big thing. Not since 78 years as that happened, but we had no wars When I was president, we defeated ISIS, but that was a war that was started that we weren’t anywhere near defeating. But think of it, I had no wars and Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary said, “The world has to have Trump back because everybody was afraid of Trump.” Now that’s what he said, so I’m not using that term, but I think they respected me. But he said, “China was afraid. Russia was afraid. Everybody was afraid.” And I don’t care what word they use, it probably that’s even a better word if you want to know the truth, but let’s use the word respect.<br>(00:40:15) 我当总统的时候，美国没有发动过战争，这是很重要的一点。78 年来都没有过这样的情况。而且我们还击败了 ISIS—— 那是一场早就开始的战争，之前根本没人能打赢。你想想，我任内没有发动战争，匈牙利总理欧尔班・维克托也说过 “世界需要特朗普回来，因为所有人都怕特朗普”。这是他说的，我不会用 “怕” 这个词，但我觉得他们是尊重我。不过他确实说 “中国怕，俄罗斯怕，所有人都怕”。说实话，不管他们用什么词，“怕” 可能比 “尊重” 更贴切，但咱们还是用 “尊重” 吧。</p>
<p>(00:40:56) They had respect for me. They had respect for the country. I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the Russian pipeline. Nobody else could have done that. I ended it. It was done. Then Biden comes in and he approved it, so we are defending Germany in these other countries for peanuts compared to what it’s worth, and they’re paying the person we’re defending them against billions and billions of dollars for energy. I said, “How does that work?” And we had it out with them and it worked out good. And they paid hundreds of billions of dollars. Or you wouldn’t even have a NATO right now. You wouldn’t have NATO if it wasn’t for me.<br>(00:40:56) 他们尊重我，也尊重美国这个国家。是我叫停了 “北溪 2 号” 天然气管道项目，就是那条俄罗斯的管道，没人能做到这一点，但我做到了。结果拜登一上台就批准了这个项目，现在我们在保护德国等国家，而他们给我们的军费却少得可怜，反而给我们要保护他们免受其害的俄罗斯支付数十亿美元的能源费用。我就想问 “这合理吗？” 我之前和他们摊牌谈过，效果很好，他们后来交了数千亿美元的军费。而且说实在的，现在北约能存在，全靠我，没有我就没有北约了。</p>
<h2 id="Power"><a href="#Power" class="headerlink" title="Power"></a>Power</h2><h2 id="权力"><a href="#权力" class="headerlink" title="权力"></a>权力</h2><p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:41:36) As the leader of the United States, you were the most powerful man in the world. As you mentioned, not only the most famous, but the most powerful. And if you become leader again, you’ll have unprecedented power. Just on your own personal psychology, what does that power do to you? Is there any threat of it corrupting how you see the world?<br>(00:41:36) 作为美国总统，你曾是世界上最有权势的人。正如你所说，你不仅最有名，也最有权势。如果能再次当选，你将拥有前所未有的权力。从你的个人心理层面来说，这种权力会对你产生什么影响？它是否存在扭曲你世界观的风险？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:41:56) No, I don’t think so. Look, I’ve been there for four years. I could have done a big number on Hillary Clinton. I thought it looked terrible to take the president’s wife and put her in prison. She’s so lucky I didn’t do anything. She’s so lucky. Hillary is a lucky woman because I had a lot of people pushing me too. They wanted to see something, but… I could have done something very bad. I thought it looked so bad. Think of it, you have the President of the United States, and you also had Secretary of State, she was, but you’re going to put the president’s wife in prison. And yet when I got out, they have all these hoaxes.<br>(00:41:56) 不，我觉得不会。你看，我已经担任过四年总统了。我本可以对希拉里・克林顿采取强硬措施，但我认为把前总统的妻子送进监狱，样子太难看了。她很幸运，我什么都没做，真的太幸运了。希拉里是个幸运的女人，当时还有很多人催我对她采取行动，他们想看到一些结果，但我还是没做。我本可以采取一些很严厉的手段，但那样实在太不像话了。你想想，她曾是国务卿，而我作为美国总统，把前总统的妻子送进监狱，这像话吗？可结果呢，我卸任后，他们却用各种骗局来针对我。</p>
<p>(00:42:37) They’re all hoaxes, but they have all these dishonest hoaxes just like they did in the past with, Russia, Russia, Russia. That was a hoax. The 51 different agencies or agents, that was a hoax. The whole thing was a hoax. There were so many hoaxes and scams. But I didn’t want to put her in jail, and I didn’t. And I explained it to people. They say, “Lock her up. Lock her up.” We won. I said, “We don’t want to put her in jail. We want to bring the country together. I want to bring the country together. You don’t bring the country together by putting her in jail.” But then when I got out, they went to work on me. It’s amazing. And they suffer from massive Trump derangement syndrome, TDS, and I don’t know if it’s curable from their standpoint.<br>(00:42:37) 那些全是骗局，全是不诚实的鬼把戏，就像之前的 “通俄门” 一样 —— 那就是个骗局。还有所谓 51 个机构或特工的指控，也全是骗局，整件事就是一场骗局。类似的骗局和阴谋还有很多。但我当时不想把她送进监狱，也确实没那么做。我跟大家解释过，当时人们都喊 “把她关起来！把她关起来！”，我们赢了选举，可我说 “我们不该把她关起来，我们要团结国家，我想让国家团结起来。把她关起来根本不利于国家团结”。结果我一卸任，他们就开始针对我，真是不可思议。他们都得了严重的 “特朗普失调症”（TDS），而且在我看来，这种病对他们来说可能治不好了。</p>

<p>(00:43:36) A lot of people are very interested in the footage of UFOs. The Pentagon has released a few videos, and there’s been anecdotal reports from fighter pilots, so a lot of people want to know, will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available.<br>(00:43:36) 很多人对不明飞行物（UFO）的影像资料非常感兴趣。五角大楼已经公布了几段视频，还有战斗机飞行员的轶事报告，所以很多人想知道，你是否会推动五角大楼公布更多据称已存在的影像资料？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:43:57) Oh yeah, sure, I’ll do that. I would do that. I’d love to do that. I have to do that. But they also are pushing me on Kennedy, and I did release a lot, but I had people come to me and beg me not to do it. But I’ll be doing that very early on. Yeah, no. But I would do that.<br>(00:43:57) 哦，当然，我会的。我愿意这么做，也很想这么做，我必须这么做。不过还有人催我公布肯尼迪遇刺案的相关资料，我之前已经公布了很多，但有人来求我别再公布了。不过我很快还会继续公布的。总之，关于 UFO 影像，我肯定会推动公布的。</p>
<h2 id="Jeffrey-Epstein"><a href="#Jeffrey-Epstein" class="headerlink" title="Jeffrey Epstein"></a>Jeffrey Epstein</h2><h2 id="杰弗里・爱泼斯坦"><a href="#杰弗里・爱泼斯坦" class="headerlink" title="杰弗里・爱泼斯坦"></a>杰弗里・爱泼斯坦</h2><p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:44:16) There’s a moment where you had some hesitation about Epstein releasing some of the documents on Epstein. Why the hesitation?<br>(00:44:16) 之前在公布爱泼斯坦（Jeffrey Epstein）相关文件时，你似乎有些犹豫。为什么会犹豫呢？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:44:23) I don’t think… I’m not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately, but a lot of people did.<br>(00:44:23) 我觉得…… 我和这事没关系。幸运的是，我从没去过他的那个岛，但很多人去过。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:44:33) Why do you think so many smart, powerful people allowed him to get so close?<br>(00:44:33) 你觉得为什么那么多聪明、有权势的人会让他如此接近自己？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:44:42) He was a good salesman. He was a hailing, hearty type of guy. He had some nice assets that he’d throw around like islands, but a lot of big people went to that island. But fortunately, I was not one of them.<br>(00:44:42) 他很会 “推销” 自己，是个很会活跃气氛、显得热情大方的人。他有不少像样的资产，比如那个岛，还总拿这些东西炫耀。确实有很多大人物去过那个岛，但幸运的是，我不在其中。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:44:59) It’s just very strange for a lot of people, that the list of clients that went to the island has not been made public.<br>(00:44:59) 对很多人来说，去过那个岛的客户名单至今没有公开，这实在很奇怪。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:45:08) It’s very interesting, isn’t it? It probably will be, by the way, probably.<br>(00:45:08) 确实很有意思，是吧？不过我觉得这份名单最终可能会公布的，很可能会。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:45:13) If you’re able to, you’ll be-<br>(00:45:13) 如果有能力的话，你会 ——</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:45:15) Yeah, I’d certainly take a look at it. Now, Kennedy’s interesting because it’s so many years ago. They do that for danger too, because it endangers certain people, et cetera, et cetera, so Kennedy is very different from the Epstein thing but I’d be inclined to do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it.<br>(00:45:15) 对，我肯定会关注这件事。肯尼迪案之所以特殊，是因为已经过去很多年了，而且公布相关资料可能会有风险，比如危及某些人等等，所以肯尼迪案和爱泼斯坦案不太一样。但对于爱泼斯坦案的文件，我倾向于推动公布，这对我来说没什么问题。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:45:36) That’s great to hear. What gives you strength when you’re getting attacked? You’re one of the most attacked people in the world.<br>(00:45:36) 很高兴听到你这么说。你是世界上被攻击最多的人之一，当受到攻击时，是什么给了你力量？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:45:43) I think you can’t care that much. I know people that care so much about everything, like what people are saying, you can’t care too much because you end up choking.<br>(00:45:43) 我觉得不能太在意别人的看法。我认识一些人，对所有事都太敏感，别人说什么都往心里去，这样是不行的，只会让自己束手束脚。</p>

<p>(00:45:55) One of the tragic things about life is that it ends. How often do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?<br>(00:45:55) 生命的悲剧之一在于它终有尽头。你多久会想一次自己的死亡？你害怕死亡吗？</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:46:02) I have a friend who’s very, very successful, and he’s in his 80s, mid 80s, and he asked me that exact same question. I turned it around and I said, “Well, what about you?” He said, “I think about it every minute of every day.” And then a week later, he called me to tell me something. And he starts off the conversation by going, “Tick tock, tick tock.” This is dark person in a sense, but it is what it is. If you’re religious, you have I think a better feeling toward it. You’re supposed to go to heaven, ideally, not hell, but you’re supposed to go to heaven if you’re good. I think our country’s missing a lot of religion. I think it really was a much better place with religion. It was almost a guide. To a certain extent it was a guide. You want to be good to people. Without religion there are no guardrails. I’d love to see us get back to religion, more religion in this country.<br>(00:46:02) 我有个非常成功的朋友，已经 80 多岁了，快 85 岁了，他也问过我完全一样的问题。我反问他 “那你呢？”，他说 “我每分钟都在想这件事”。一周后他给我打电话，一开口就说 “滴答，滴答（指时间流逝）”。从某种角度来说，他是个比较悲观的人，但事实就是这样。我觉得有宗教信仰的人对死亡的心态会更好一些 —— 理想情况下，好人应该上天堂，而不是下地狱。我认为我们国家现在太缺乏宗教信仰了，有宗教信仰的时候，这个国家要美好得多。宗教几乎就像一个指引，在某种程度上确实能指引人向善，让人愿意对别人好。没有宗教，就没有了道德约束。我希望我们能重拾宗教信仰，让这个国家有更多的宗教氛围。</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:47:09) Well, Mr. President, thank you for putting yourself out there, and thank you for talking today.<br>(00:47:09) 总统先生，感谢你愿意坦诚交流，也感谢你今天抽出时间对话。</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>(00:47:13) Look, I love the country. I want to see the country be great, and we have a real chance at doing it, but it’s our last chance and I appreciate it very much.<br>(00:47:13) 是这样，我热爱这个国家，我希望看到它变得伟大，我们现在确实有机会做到，但这可能是我们最后的机会了。非常感谢你的邀请。</p>

I’ve been doing this podcast for over six years, and I first and foremost have to say thank you. I’m truly grateful for the support and the love I’ve gotten along the way. It’s been, I would say, the most unlikely journey.<br>(00:47:25) 感谢收听本期与唐纳德・特朗普的对话。若想支持本播客，请查看简介中的赞助商信息。现在，就像我在部分节目结尾开始做的那样，我会做一些评论并回答几个问题。如果大家想提交问题（包括音频和视频形式），可以访问<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lexfridman.com/ama">lexfridman.com&#x2F;ama</a>；若有其他事宜想联系我，可访问<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lexfridman.com/contact">lexfridman.com&#x2F;contact</a>。通常做这段环节时我会穿 T 恤，但本期我决定还是穿着西装领带。首先，或许现在是个回顾的好时机 —— 我做这个播客已经六年多了，首先必须说声谢谢。非常感谢大家一路走来的支持与喜爱，这段旅程真的充满了意外与惊喜。</p>
<p>(00:48:16) And on most days, I barely feel like I know what I’m doing. But I wanted to talk a bit about how I approach these conversations. Now, each conversation is its own unique puzzle, so I can’t speak generally to how I approach these, but here it may be useful to describe how I approach conversations with world leaders, of which I hope to have many more and do a better job every time. I read a lot of history and I admire the historian perspective. As an example, I admire William Shirer, the author of many books on Hitler, including The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. He was there and lived through it and covered it objectively to the degree that one could. Academic historians, by the way, criticize him for being a poor historian because he editorialized a little too much. I think those same folks criticized Dan Carlin and his Hardcore History podcast.<br>(00:48:16) 大多数时候，我都觉得自己好像并不知道在做什么。但我想聊聊我是如何准备这类对话的。每一次对话都是独一无二的难题，所以我无法一概而论，但或许可以说说我如何与世界领导人对话 —— 我希望能有更多这样的对话，并且每次都能做得更好。我读了很多历史书，也很欣赏历史学家的视角。比如，我很敬佩威廉・夏伊勒（William Shirer），他写了很多关于希特勒的书，包括《第三帝国的兴亡》。他亲身经历过那个时代，并且尽可能客观地记录了那段历史。不过，学术派历史学家批评他算不上优秀的历史学家，因为他加入了太多个人评论。我想，这些人也批评过丹・卡林（Dan Carlin）和他的《硬核历史》播客。</p>
<p>(00:49:15) I respect their criticism, but I fundamentally disagree, so in these conversations with world leaders, I try to put on my historian hat. I think in the realm of truth and public discourse, there’s a spectrum between the ephemeral and the eternal. The outraged mob and clickbait journalists are often focused on the ephemeral, the current thing, the current viral shitstormer of mockery and derision. But when the battle of the day is done, most of it will be forgotten. A few true ideas will remain, and those the historian hopes to capture. Now, this is much easier said than done. It’s not just about having the right ideals and the integrity to stick by them. It’s not even just about having the actual skill of talking, which I still think I suck at, but let’s say it’s a work in progress. You also have to make the scheduling work and set up the entirety of the environment in a way that is conducive to such a conversation.<br>(00:49:15) 我尊重他们的批评，但从根本上我并不认同。所以在与世界领导人对话时，我会试着以历史学家的视角去切入。我认为在真相与公共讨论的领域，存在 “短暂” 与 “永恒” 两个极端。愤怒的民众和标题党记者往往关注短暂的热点 —— 当下的事件、当下 viral 的嘲讽与挖苦。但当当天的争议过去后，这些大多会被遗忘，只有少数真实的观点会留存下来，而历史学家希望捕捉的正是这些。当然，说起来容易做起来难。这不仅需要正确的理念和坚守理念的正直，甚至不仅需要对话的技巧（我至今仍觉得自己在这方面很糟糕，只能说还在进步中），还需要协调时间安排，并营造一个有利于这类对话的整体环境。</p>
<p>(00:50:19) This is hard, really hard with political and business leaders. They are usually super busy and in some cases super nervous because, well, they’ve been screwed over so many times with clickbait got you journalism, so to convince them and their team to talk for two, three, four, five hours is hard. And I do think a good conversation requires that kind of duration. And I’ve been thinking a lot about why. I don’t think it’s just about needing the actual time of three hours to cover all the content. I think the longer form with a hypothetical skilled conversationalist, relaxes things and allows people to go on tangents and to banter about the details because I-<br>(00:50:19) 这很难，尤其是和政界、商界领导人对话时，难度极大。他们通常非常忙，有时还会非常紧张 —— 因为他们已经被标题党新闻坑过太多次了。所以要说服他们和团队花两、三、四、五个小时对话，难度很大。但我确实认为，一场好的对话需要这样的时长。我也一直在思考原因：这不仅仅是因为需要三小时来覆盖所有内容，更因为在有经验的对话者引导下，长时间的交流能让人放松，允许人们偏离主线、聊聊细节，因为我 ——</p>
<p>Lex Fridman</p>
<p>(00:51:00) … agents and to banter about the details, because I think it’s in the details that the beautiful complexity of the person is brought to light. Anyway, I look forward to talking to more world leaders and doing a better job every time as I said. I would love to do interviews with Kamala Harris and some other political figures on the left and right, including Tim Walz, AOC, Bernie, Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary. And on the right, J.D. Vance, Vivek, George W. and so on. And on the topic of politics, let me say, as an immigrant, I love this country, the United States of America. I do believe it is the greatest nation on earth, and I’m grateful for the people on the left and the right who step into the arena of politics to fight for this country that I do believe they all love as well.<br>(00:51:00) …… 聊聊细节，因为我认为正是在这些细节中，一个人美好而复杂的特质才能被展现出来。总之，正如我所说，我期待能与更多世界领导人对话，并且每次都能做得更好。我很想采访卡玛拉・哈里斯，以及其他左右派政治人物 —— 左翼包括蒂姆・瓦尔兹（Tim Walz）、亚历山大・奥卡西奥 - 科尔特斯（AOC）、伯尼・桑德斯（Bernie）、巴拉克・奥巴马、比尔・克林顿和希拉里・克林顿；右翼包括 J・D・万斯（J.D. Vance）、维韦克・拉马斯瓦米（Vivek）、乔治・W・布什等。说到政治，作为一名移民，我想表达：我爱美国这个国家，我坚信它是世界上最伟大的国家。我也很感谢那些无论左翼还是右翼、愿意踏入政坛为这个国家奋斗的人 —— 我相信他们也都热爱这个国家。</p>
<p>(00:51:52) I have reached out to Kamala Harris, but not many of the others. I probably should do a better job with that, but I’ve been doing most of this myself, all the reach out, scheduling, research prep, recording and so on. And on top of that, I very much have been suffering from imposter syndrome with a voice in my head constantly pointing out when I’m doing a shitty job. Plus a few folks graciously remind me on the internet, the very same sentiment of this aforementioned voice. All of this, while I have the option of just hiding away at MIT, programming robots and doing some cool AI research with a few grad students, or maybe joining an AI company or maybe starting my own, all these options make me truly happy. But like I said, on most days I barely know what I’m doing, so who knows what the future holds. Most importantly, I’m forever grateful for all of you for your patience and your support throughout this rollercoaster of the life I’ve been on. I love you all.<br>(00:51:52) 我已经联系过卡玛拉・哈里斯，但还没联系过其他大多数人。或许我应该在这方面做得更好，但目前大部分工作都是我自己做的 —— 联系嘉宾、安排时间、准备研究资料、录制等等。除此之外，我还深受 “冒名顶替综合征”（imposter syndrome）困扰，脑子里总有人在说 “你做得真差”。而且网上也有人 “好心” 提醒我，说的话和我脑子里的声音如出一辙。其实我本可以选择躲在麻省理工学院（MIT）里，编程机器人、和研究生一起做有趣的人工智能研究，或者加入一家 AI 公司，甚至自己创业 —— 这些选择都能让我真正开心。但就像我说的，大多数时候我都不知道自己在做什么，所以未来会怎样谁也说不准。最重要的是，感谢大家在我这段跌宕起伏的人生旅程中给予我的耐心和支持，我爱你们所有人。</p>
<p>(00:52:51) Okay, now let me go on to some of the questions that people had. I was asked by a few people to comment on Pavel Durov’s arrest and on X being banned in Brazil. Let me first briefly comment on the Durov arrest. Basic facts, Pavel Durov is CEO of Telegram, which is a messenger app that has end-to-end encryption mode. It’s not on by default, and most people don’t use the end-to-end encryption, but some do. Pavel was arrested in France on a long list of charges related to “criminal activity” carried out on the Telegram platform, and for “providing unlicensed cryptology services.” I think Telegram is indeed used for criminal activity by a small minority of its users, for example, by terrorist groups to communicate. And I think we all agree that terrorism is bad.<br>(00:52:51) 好的，现在来回答大家的一些问题。有人让我评论帕维尔・杜罗夫（Pavel Durov）被捕和 X（原 Twitter）在巴西被禁的事。先简单说说杜罗夫被捕事件：基本情况是，帕维尔・杜罗夫是即时通讯应用 Telegram 的 CEO，该应用有端到端加密模式 —— 默认不开启，大多数人也不用，但确实有人使用。杜罗夫在法国被捕，指控罪名很多，包括 “Telegram 平台上存在犯罪活动” 以及 “提供未经授权的加密服务”。我认为，Telegram 确实被少数用户用于犯罪活动，比如恐怖组织用它通信，而我们都认同恐怖主义是邪恶的。</p>
<p>(00:53:47) But here’s the problem. As the old saying goes, one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. And there are many cases in which the world unilaterally agrees who the terrorists are, but there are other cases when governments, especially authoritarian inclined governments, tend to propagandize and just call whoever’s in the opposition, whoever opposes them, terrorists. There is some room for nuance here, but, to me at this time, it seems to obviously be a power grab by government wanting to have backdoor access into every platform so they can have censorship power against the opposition. I think generally governments should stay out of censoring or even pressuring social media platforms, and I think arresting a CEO of a tech company for the things said on the platform he built is just nuts. It has a chilling effect on him, on people working at Telegram and on people working at every social media company, and also people thinking of launching a new social media company.<br>(00:53:47) 但问题在于，正如老话所说 “一个人的恐怖分子是另一个人的自由战士”。有些情况下，国际社会对 “谁是恐怖分子” 有共识，但在另一些情况下，某些政府（尤其是倾向威权的政府）会通过宣传，把所有反对者都称为 “恐怖分子”。这里确实存在细微差别，但在我看来，目前这件事显然是政府在争夺权力 —— 他们想获得每个平台的 “后门访问权”，以便能审查反对声音。我认为，政府通常不应干预甚至施压社交媒体平台，更不该因为平台上有人发表了某些言论，就逮捕该平台的 CEO—— 这太荒唐了。这不仅会让杜罗夫、Telegram 员工感到寒心，还会影响所有社交媒体公司的员工，以及那些想创办新社交媒体公司的人。</p>
<p>(00:54:50) Same as the case of X being banned in Brazil. It’s, I think, a power grab by Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice in Brazil. He ordered X to block certain accounts that are spreading “misinformation.” Elon and X denied the request, then de Moraes threatened to arrest X representatives in Brazil, and in response to that X pulled the representatives out of Brazil obviously to protect them. And now X, having no representatives in Brazil, apparently violates the law. Based on this de Moraes banned X in Brazil. Once again, it’s an authoritarian figure seeking censorship power over the channels of communication.<br>(00:54:50) X 在巴西被禁的情况也类似。我认为这是巴西最高法院大法官亚历山大・德莫赖斯（Alexandre de Moraes）在争夺权力。他下令 X 封禁某些传播 “虚假信息” 的账户，埃隆・马斯克（Elon Musk）和 X 拒绝了这一要求，随后德莫赖斯威胁要逮捕 X 在巴西的代表。为保护员工，X 显然撤走了在巴西的代表。但现在，“X 在巴西没有代表” 又被指违法，德莫赖斯据此封禁了 X 在巴西的服务。这再次表明，威权人物在试图掌控通信渠道的审查权。</p>
<p>(00:55:34) I understand that this is complicated because there are evil people in the world and part of the role of government is to protect us from those evil people. But as Benjamin Franklin said, “Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” It’s a trade-off, but I think in many places in the world, many governments have leaned too far away at this time from liberty.<br>(00:55:34) 我明白这事很复杂 —— 世界上确实有坏人，而政府的部分职责就是保护我们免受坏人伤害。但正如本杰明・富兰克林所说：“为了获得暂时的安全而放弃基本自由的人，既不配拥有自由，也不配拥有安全。” 这是一种权衡，但我认为目前世界上很多地方的政府都在过度偏离 “自由” 的方向。</p>
<p>(00:56:02) Okay, next up I got a question on AI, which I emotionally connected with. I’ll condense it as follows. “Hello, Lex. I’m a programmer and I have a deep fear of slipping into irrelevance because I am worried that AI will soon exceed my programming skills.”<br>(00:56:02) 好的，下一个问题和人工智能（AI）有关，我对此深有共鸣。我把问题精简一下：“莱克斯你好，我是一名程序员，非常害怕自己会变得无关紧要，因为我担心 AI 很快就会超越我的编程技能。”</p>
<p>(00:56:23) Let me first say that I relate to your fear. It’s scary to have a thing that gives you a career and gives you meaning to be taken away. For me, programming is a passion, and if not for this podcast, it would probably at least in part be my profession so I get an uncomfortable feeling every time, Claude, the LLM I use for coding at this time just writes a lot of excellent approximately correct code. I think you can make a good case that it already exceeds the skill of many programmers, at least in the same way that the collective intelligence of stack overflow exceeds the skill of many individual programmers, but in many ways it still does not. But I think eventually more and more the task, the professional programming will be one of writing natural language prompts. I think the right thing to do, and what I’m at least doing is to ride the wave of the ever improving code generating LLMs and keep transforming myself into a big picture designer versus low-level tinkerer. What I’m doing and what I recommend you do is continually switch to whatever state-of-the-art tool is for generating code. For me, currently I recently switched from VS Code to Cursor, and before that it was Emacs to VS Code switch. Cursor is this editor that’s based on VS Code that leans heavily on LLMs and integrates the co-generation really nicely into the editing process. It makes it super easy to continually use the LLMs. What I would advise and what I’m trying to do myself is to learn how to use it and to master its co-generation capabilities. I, personally, try to now allocate a significant amount of time to designing with natural language first versus writing code from scratch, so using my understanding of programming to edit the code that’s generated by the LLM versus writing it from scratch and then using the LLM to generate small parts of the code. I see it as a skill that I should develop in parallel to my programming skill.<br>(00:56:23) 首先我想说，我很理解你的恐惧。当一份能给你职业、给你人生意义的技能可能被夺走时，那种感觉确实很可怕。对我来说，编程是一种热爱，如果不是做这个播客，编程很可能至少是我职业的一部分。所以每次我用 Claude（我现在用来编程的大语言模型）写代码时，看到它写出大量优秀且基本正确的代码，我都会感到不安。可以说，它已经超越了很多程序员的技能 —— 至少就像 Stack Overflow 的集体智慧超越很多个体程序员一样，但在很多方面它还做不到。不过我认为，最终专业编程的核心任务会越来越偏向 “写自然语言提示词”。我认为正确的做法（也是我正在做的）是：跟上代码生成大语言模型不断进步的浪潮，把自己从 “底层调试者” 转变为 “全局设计者”。我建议你也这样做：不断切换到最先进的代码生成工具。比如我最近就从 VS Code 换成了 Cursor（之前是从 Emacs 换成 VS Code）。Cursor 是基于 VS Code 的编辑器，非常依赖大语言模型，能很好地将代码协同生成融入编辑过程，让使用大语言模型变得超级简单。我的建议是，你要学习并掌握这类工具的协同生成能力 —— 我自己现在就会花大量时间先用自然语言设计，而不是从零写代码；我会用自己的编程知识去修改大语言模型生成的代码，而不是先从零写，再让模型生成小部分代码。我认为这是一种需要和编程技能并行发展的能力。</p>
<p>(00:58:34) I think this applies to many other careers too. Don’t compete with AI for your job, learn to use the AI to do that job better. But yes, it is scary in some deep human level, the threat of being replaced. But at least I think we’ll be okay.<br>(00:58:34) 我认为这也适用于很多其他职业：不要和 AI 争夺工作，而要学会用 AI 把工作做得更好。当然，从人类深层情感来说，被替代的威胁确实很可怕，但至少我认为我们最终会没事的。</p>
<p>(00:58:55) All right, next up, I got a very nice audio message and question from a gentleman who is 27 and feeling a lot of anxiety about the future. Just recently he graduated with a bachelor’s degree and he’s thinking about going to grad school for biomedical engineering, but there is a lot of anxiety. He mentioned anxiety many times in the message. It took him an extra while to get his degree, so he mentioned he would be 32 by the time he’s done with his PhD, so it’s a big investment. But he said in his heart he feels like he’s a scientist. I think that’s the most important part of his message, of your message. By the way, I’ll figure out how to best include audio and video messages in future episodes.<br>(00:58:55) 好的，下一个问题来自一位 27 岁的男士，他发来一段语音，说自己对未来充满焦虑。他最近刚拿到学士学位，在考虑去读生物医学工程的研究生，但焦虑感很重 —— 他在留言里多次提到 “焦虑”。他拿到学士学位花了比别人更长的时间，所以他说如果读博，毕业时就 32 岁了，这是一笔很大的投入。但他说 “在心里，我觉得自己是个科学家”—— 我认为这是他留言里最重要的一点。顺便说一句，我会想办法在未来的节目中更好地融入音频和视频留言。</p>
<p>(00:59:37) Now onto the question. Thank you for telling me your story and for submitting the question. My own life story is similar to yours. I went to Drexel University for my bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate degrees, and I took a while just as you’re doing. I did a lot of non-standard things that weren’t any good for some hypothetical career I’m supposed to have. I trained and competed in Judo and Jiu Jitsu for my entire 20s, got a black belt from it. I wrote a lot, including a lot of really crappy poetry. I read a large amount of non-technical books, history, philosophy, and literature. I took courses on literature and philosophy that weren’t at all required for my computer science and electrical engineering degrees, like a course on James Joyce. I played guitar in bars around town. I took a lot of technical classes, many, for example, on theoretical computer science that were way more than were needed for the degree. I did a lot of research and I coded up a bunch of projects that didn’t directly contribute to my dissertation. It was pure curiosity and the joy of exploring.<br>(00:59:37) 现在来回答这个问题。感谢你分享自己的故事并提问，我的人生经历其实和你很像。我在德雷塞尔大学（Drexel University）读了本科、硕士和博士，也像你一样花了很长时间。我做了很多 “不按常理” 的事，这些事对我 “本该有的” 职业规划毫无帮助：20 多岁的整个十年，我都在训练和参加柔道、柔术比赛，还拿到了黑带；我写了很多东西，包括一堆很糟糕的诗；我读了大量非技术类书籍 —— 历史、哲学、文学；我选了很多计算机科学和电气工程专业不需要的文学、哲学课程，比如一门关于詹姆斯・乔伊斯（James Joyce）的课；我还在镇上的酒吧弹吉他；我选了很多超出学位要求的技术课，比如很多理论计算机科学的课；我做了很多研究，编了很多和论文无关的项目 —— 这一切都只是出于纯粹的好奇心和探索的乐趣。</p>
<p>(01:00:54) Like you, I took the long way home, as they say, and I regret none of it. Throughout that, people around me and even people who love me wanted me to hurry up and to focus, especially because I had very little money, and so I had a sense like time was running out for me to take the needed steps towards a reasonable career. And just like you, I was filled with anxiety and I still am filled with anxiety to this day, but I think the right thing to do is not to run away from the anxiety, but to lean into it and channel it into pursuing with everything you got, the things you’re passionate about.<br>(01:00:54) 就像你一样，我走了一条 “绕远路” 的人生，但我一点也不后悔。那段时间里，身边的人甚至爱我的人都希望我能快点 “步入正轨”、专注于学业，尤其是因为我当时没什么钱，总觉得自己要赶紧为 “合理的职业” 做准备，否则时间就来不及了。和你一样，我当时充满了焦虑，直到现在也依然有焦虑，但我认为正确的做法不是逃避焦虑，而是直面它，把它转化为动力，全力以赴去追求自己热爱的事情。</p>
<p>(01:01:36) As you said, very importantly, in your heart you know you’re a scientist, so that’s it. You know exactly what to do. Pursue the desire to be a scientist with everything you got. Get to a good grad school, find a good advisor and do epic shit with them. And it may turn out in the end that your life will have unexpected chapters, but as long as you’re chasing dreams and goals with absolute unwavering dedication, good stuff will come of it. And also try your best to be a good person. This might be a good place to read the words If by Roger Kipling that I often return to when I feel lost and I’m looking for guidance on how to be a better man.<br>(01:01:36) 最重要的是，正如你所说，“在心里，你知道自己是个科学家”—— 这就够了。你很清楚自己该做什么：全力以赴去追求成为科学家的愿望。申请一所好的研究生院，找一位好导师，和他们一起做了不起的研究。或许最终你的人生会有意外的篇章，但只要你坚定不移地追逐梦想和目标，好事就一定会发生。另外，也要尽力做个好人。或许在这里，我可以读一段拉迪亚德・吉卜林（Roger Kipling）的《如果》（If）—— 每当我感到迷茫、想知道如何成为更好的人时，我都会读这首诗。</p>
<p>(01:02:18) “If you can keep your head when all about your losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about, don’t deal in lies or being hated, don’t give weight to hating and yet don’t look too good nor talk too wise. If you can dream and not make dreams your master. If you can think and not make thoughts your aim. If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same. If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn out tools. If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss. If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they’re gone and so hold on when there’s nothing in you except the will, which says to them, hold on. If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings nor lose the common touch. If neither foes, nor loving friends can hurt you. If all men count with you, but none too much. If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that’s in it. And which is more, you’ll be a man, my son.”<br>(01:02:18) “如果所有人都失去理智，咒骂你，你仍能保持头脑清醒；如果所有人都怀疑你，你仍能坚信自己，同时宽容他们的怀疑；如果你等待，不要因此厌烦，为人所骗，不要因此骗人，为人所恨，不要因此抱恨，不要太乐观，也不要自以为是；如果你有梦想，不要让梦想控制你；如果你有思想，不要让思想成为你的目标；如果你遇到胜利和灾难，要把两者都当作骗子看待；如果你能忍受，你曾讲过的真理被恶棍扭曲，用于蒙骗傻子，或者看着你用毕生去追求的东西被破坏，然后俯身，用破旧的工具把它修补；如果你能把所有赢来的筹码都押在一把赌注上，输光后仍能重新开始，且绝口不提自己的损失；如果你能强迫自己，在身体疲惫不堪时，仍能咬牙坚持，只因心中的意志在说‘坚持’；如果你能与平民交谈而不失风度，与国王同行而不忘谦逊；如果敌人和挚友都无法伤害你；如果所有人都对你重要，但没有人过于重要；如果你能把每一分钟都当作 60 秒来利用，填满这无情的时光，那么，世界和它的一切都属于你，更重要的是，我的孩子，你将成为一个真正的人。”</p>
<p>(01:04:05) Thank you for listening and see you next time.<br>(01:04:05) 感谢收听，我们下期再见。</p>
