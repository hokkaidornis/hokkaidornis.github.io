<p>March 2012</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s 7th birthday was March 11. As usual we were so busy we didn’t notice till a few days after. I don’t think we’ve ever managed to remember our birthday on our birthday.</p>
<p>Y Combinator的7岁生日是3月11日。和往常一样，我们太忙了，直到几天后才想起来。我想我们从来没有在生日当天记得过自己的生日。</p>
<p>On March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner in Harvard Square. Jessica was working at an investment bank at the time, but she didn’t like it much, so she had interviewed for a job as director of marketing at a Boston VC fund. The VC fund was doing what now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do: taking a long time to make up their mind. Meanwhile I had been telling Jessica all the things they should change about the VC business — essentially the ideas now underlying Y Combinator: investors should be making more, smaller investments, they should be funding hackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund younger founders, etc.<br>2005年3月11日，Jessica和我从哈佛广场吃完晚餐步行回家。当时Jessica在一家投资银行工作，但她不太喜欢那份工作，所以她面试了波士顿一家风险投资基金的营销总监职位。这家风投基金正在做一件现在看来颇具讽刺意味的熟悉事情：迟迟不做决定。同时，我一直在告诉Jessica风投行业应该改变的所有事情——基本上就是现在构成Y Combinator基础的理念：投资者应该做更多、更小的投资，他们应该资助黑客而不是西装革履的商人，他们应该愿意资助更年轻的创始人等等。</p>
<p>At the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing. I had just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvard about how to start a startup, and it hit me afterward that although I had always meant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I got enough money to do it, and I still hadn’t started. I had also been thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell again. A few hours before I had sent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together.<br>那时我一直在考虑做一些天使投资。我刚在哈佛大学本科生计算机俱乐部做了一个关于如何创业的演讲，之后我突然意识到，尽管我一直打算做天使投资，但自从我有足够资金做这件事已经过去了7年，而我仍然没有开始。我也一直在思考如何再次与Robert Morris和Trevor Blackwell合作。几小时前，我给他们发了一封电子邮件，试图找出我们可以一起做的事情。</p>
<p>Between Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled. We’d start our own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead. As we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it. I agreed to put 100kintothenewfundandJessicaagreedtoquitherjobtoworkforit.OverthenextcoupledaysIrecruitedRobertandTrevor,whoputinanother50k each. So YC started with $200k.<br>从哈佛广场到我家的路上，这个想法逐渐成形。我们要创办自己的投资公司，Jessica可以在那里工作。当我们拐到Walker Street时，我们决定就这么做。我同意向新基金投入10万美元，Jessica同意辞去工作加入。在接下来的几天里，我招募了Robert和Trevor，他们每人又投入了5万美元。所以YC以20万美元起步。</p>
<p>Jessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her own company that I took her picture when we got home.<br>Jessica能够辞去工作开始自己的公司是如此开心，以至于我们到家时我给她拍了张照片。</p>
<p>The company wasn’t called Y Combinator yet. At first we called it Cambridge Seed. But that name never saw the light of day, because by the time we announced it a few days later, we’d changed the name to Y Combinator. We realized early on that what we were doing could be national in scope and we didn’t want a name that tied us to one place.<br>公司当时还不叫Y Combinator。起初我们称它为Cambridge Seed。但这个名字从未见光，因为当我们几天后宣布时，我们已经将名字改为了Y Combinator。我们很早就意识到我们所做的工作可能会在全国范围内展开，我们不想要一个将我们限制在一个地方的名称。</p>
<p>Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do seed funding with standardized terms. Before YC, seed funding was very haphazard. You’d get that first $10k from your friend’s rich uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents should look like. Facebook’s early history as a Florida LLC shows how random things could be in those days. We were going to be something there had not been before: a standard source of seed funding.<br>最初我们只有部分想法。我们打算用标准化条款进行种子投资。在YC之前，种子投资非常随意。你会从你朋友富有的叔叔那里获得第一笔1万美元。交易条款往往是灾难性的；通常投资者、创始人和律师都不知道文件应该是什么样子。Facebook早期作为佛罗里达州有限责任公司的历史展示了那个时代事情可以多么随意。我们打算成为前所未有的东西：一个标准化的种子资金来源。</p>
<p>We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken when we started Viaweb. We started Viaweb with 10kwegotfromourfriendJulianWeber,thehusbandofIdelleWeber,whosepaintingclassItookasagradstudentatHarvard.Julianknewaboutbusiness,butyouwouldnotdescribehimasasuit.Amongotherthingshe<br>′<br> dbeenpresidentoftheNationalLampoon.Hewasalsoalawyer,andgotallourpaperworksetupproperly.Inreturnfor10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what business was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian got 10% of Viaweb. I remember thinking once what a good deal Julian got. And then a second later I realized that without Julian, Viaweb would never have made it. So even though it was a good deal for him, it was a good deal for us too. That’s why I knew there was room for something like Y Combinator.<br>我们以自己创办Viaweb时获得的种子资金为模型创建了YC。我们用从朋友Julian Weber那里获得的1万美元创办了Viaweb，Julian是Idelle Weber的丈夫，我在哈佛读研究生时上过Idelle的绘画课。Julian懂商业，但你不会把他描述为一个西装革履的商人。他曾担任《国家讽刺》杂志的总裁。他也是一名律师，帮我们妥善处理了所有文件。作为1万美元、帮我们成立公司、教我们商业知识以及在危机时刻保持冷静的回报，Julian获得了Viaweb 10%的股份。我记得有一次我想Julian得到了多好的交易。但一秒钟后我意识到，没有Julian，Viaweb永远不会成功。所以尽管这对他来说是个好交易，对我们来说也是个好交易。这就是为什么我知道像Y Combinator这样的东西有存在空间。</p>
<p>Initially we didn’t have what turned out to be the most important idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as it had always been done before. Or rather we had the idea, but we didn’t realize its significance. We decided very early that the first thing we’d do would be to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer. But we didn’t realize initially that this would be the way we’d do all our investing. The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups at once was not that we thought it would be a better way to fund startups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angel investors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastest way to do it. No one takes summer jobs that seriously. The opportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer working on startups was low enough that we wouldn’t feel guilty encouraging them to do it.<br>最初我们没有后来证明是最重要的想法：同步资助初创公司，而不是像以前那样异步进行。或者更准确地说，我们有这个想法，但我们没有意识到它的重要性。我们很早就决定，我们要做的第一件事就是在即将到来的夏天资助一批初创公司。但最初我们没有意识到这将成为我们所有投资的方式。我们开始一次性资助一批初创公司的原因并不是因为我们认为这是资助初创公司更好的方式，而是因为我们想学习如何成为天使投资者，而针对本科生的暑期项目似乎是最快的方法。没有人会非常认真地对待暑期工作。一群本科生花一个夏天在初创公司工作的机会成本足够低，我们不会因为鼓励他们这样做而感到内疚。</p>
<p>We knew students would already be making plans for the summer, so we did what we’re always telling startups to do: we launched fast. Here are the initial announcement and description of what was at the time called the Summer Founders Program.<br>我们知道学生已经开始为夏天做计划，所以我们做了我们一直告诉初创公司要做的事情：快速启动。以下是当时被称为”夏季创始人计划”的初始公告和描述。</p>
<p>We got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer program turns out to be perfect for what we do. The structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to what it was that first summer.<br>我们很幸运，暑期项目的长度和结构恰好完美适合我们的工作。YC周期的结构至今几乎与那个第一个夏天完全相同。</p>
<p>We also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were. We never expected to make any money from that first batch. We thought of the money we were investing as a combination of an educational expense and a charitable donation. But the founders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good. And great people too. We’re still friends with a lot of them today.<br>我们在第一批创始人的人选上也很幸运。我们从未期望从第一批人身上赚到钱。我们把投资的钱视为教育支出和慈善捐赠的结合。但第一批创始人出人意料地优秀。而且是很好的人。今天我们仍然与他们中的许多人保持友谊。</p>
<p>It’s hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the time. I can’t blame people who didn’t take us seriously, because we ourselves didn’t take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning. But as the summer progressed we were increasingly impressed by how well the startups were doing. Other people started to be impressed too. Jessica and I invented a term, “the Y Combinator effect,” to describe the moment when the realization hit someone that YC was not totally lame. When people came to YC to speak at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone coming to address a Boy Scout troop. By the time they left the building they were all saying some variant of “Wow, these companies might actually succeed.”<br>现在人们很难意识到当时YC看起来多么微不足道。我不能责怪那些不认真对待我们的人，因为一开始我们自己也没有认真对待那个第一个暑期项目。但随着夏天的推移，初创公司的表现让我们越来越印象深刻。其他人也开始印象深刻。Jessica和我创造了一个术语，”Y Combinator效应”，用来描述当有人意识到YC并非完全无用时的那个时刻。当人们在第一个夏天来YC参加晚餐演讲时，他们带着像是来给童子军演讲的心态而来。当他们离开大楼时，他们都在说类似”哇，这些公司可能真的会成功”的话。</p>
<p>Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised when the companies we fund are legit, but it took a while for reputation to catch up with reality. That’s one of the reasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed as “toys” — because YC itself was dismissed as one initially.<br>现在YC已经足够出名，人们不再对我们资助的公司是合法的感到惊讶，但声誉跟上现实花了一段时间。这也是我们特别喜欢资助那些可能被视为”玩具”的想法的原因之一——因为YC本身最初也被视为一种玩具。</p>
<p>When we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously, we decided we’d keep doing that. We’d fund two batches of startups a year.<br>当我们看到同步资助公司效果如此之好时，我们决定继续这样做。我们每年将资助两批初创公司。</p>
<p>We funded the second batch in Silicon Valley. That was a last minute decision. In retrospect I think what pushed me over the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall. The density of startup people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the weather was so nice. I remembered that from living there in the 90s. Plus I didn’t want someone else to copy us and describe it as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. I wanted YC to be the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley. So doing the winter batch in California seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice and the ambitious one were the same.<br>我们在硅谷资助了第二批公司。那是一个临时决定。回想起来，我认为推动我做这个决定的是那年秋天去参加Foo Camp。湾区初创公司人员的密度远高于波士顿，而且天气很好。我90年代在那里生活时就记得这一点。另外，我不想让别人抄袭我们，称其为”硅谷的Y Combinator”。我想让YC成为”硅谷的Y Combinator”。所以在加州做冬季批次似乎是那种罕见的情况之一，自我放纵的选择和雄心勃勃的选择是相同的。</p>
<p>If we’d had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would have been in Berkeley. That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn’t have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn’t have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.<br>如果我们有足够的时间做我们想做的事，Y Combinator会在伯克利。那是我们最喜欢的湾区地区。但我们没有时间在伯克利找一栋建筑。我们没有时间在任何地方找到自己的建筑。唯一能及时获得足够空间的方法是说服Trevor让我们接管他在山景城的（当时看起来）巨大的建筑的一部分。我们又一次幸运了，因为山景城被证明是放置像YC这样的东西的理想地方。但即使如此，我们也勉强赶上了。在加州的第一次晚餐，我们必须警告所有创始人不要触摸墙壁，因为油漆还没干。</p>
