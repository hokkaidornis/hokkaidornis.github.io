I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That’s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word “startup” dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.</p><p>（本文最初发表于《黑客与画家》）</p><p>如果你想致富，你会怎么做？我认为最好的办法是创办或加入一家创业公司。几百年来，这一直是一条可靠的致富途径。“创业公司” 一词可追溯到 20 世纪 60 年代，但创业公司所做的事，与中世纪那些有风险投资支持的贸易远航极为相似。</p><p>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase “high-tech startup” is almost redundant. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.</p><p>创业公司通常与技术相关，以至于 “高科技创业公司” 这个说法几乎显得多余。创业公司就是一家致力于解决棘手技术问题的小公司。</p><p>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don’t have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?</p><p>很多人仅凭这一点就发了财。就像优秀的棒球投手不一定需要懂物理一样，创业也未必需要懂底层逻辑。但我认为，理解这些底层逻辑能让你更有优势。为什么创业公司必须保持小规模？随着规模扩大，创业公司是否必然不再是 “创业公司”？它们为什么常常专注于开发新技术？为什么有那么多创业公司在研发新药或开发软件，却没有一家在卖玉米油或洗衣液？</p><p><strong>The Proposition</strong></p><h3 id="核心逻辑"><a href="#核心逻辑" class="headerlink" title="核心逻辑"></a><strong>核心逻辑</strong></h3><p>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</p><p>从经济角度看，创业可以理解为一种将整个职业生涯压缩到几年内的方式。你不必低强度地工作四十年，而是尽最大可能高强度地工作四年。这在技术领域的回报尤其丰厚，因为在这个领域，快速工作能带来额外收益。</p><p>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you’re a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour. [1] You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I’m claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you’re expected to be in a random corporate job. [2] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.</p><p>以下是这种经济逻辑的简要概述。如果你是一名 25 岁左右的优秀黑客，你能找到一份年薪约 8 万美元的工作。因此，平均来看，这样的黑客每年至少要为公司创造 8 万美元的价值，公司才能实现收支平衡。你或许能比企业员工多工作一倍的时间，而且如果专注投入，每小时的产出可能是他们的三倍。[1] 此外，在大公司里，你得忍受那些 “地中海发型” 中层经理的拖累，而创业能让你摆脱这种拖累，这至少又能带来一倍的效率提升。还有一个乘数：你比岗位描述所期望的水平要聪明多少？假设这个乘数是 3。把所有这些乘数相乘，我认为你在创业时的生产力，可能是在普通企业岗位上的 36 倍。[2] 如果一名不错的黑客在大公司年薪 8 万美元，那么一名聪明的黑客在没有企业繁文缛节拖累的情况下拼命工作，每年应该能创造约 300 万美元的价值。</p><p>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn’t try to defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I’m not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.</p><p>和所有粗略估算一样，这个数字有很大浮动空间。我不会去辩护具体的数值，但我坚信这个计算逻辑。我不是说乘数精确到 36，但它肯定超过 10，而且可能很少达到 100。</p><p>If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we’re talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.</p><p>如果 300 万美元一年听起来太高，要记住我们说的是极限情况：你不仅没有休闲时间，甚至工作到危害健康的程度。</p><p>Startups are not magic. They don’t change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars’ worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can’t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.</p><p>创业并非魔法，它不会改变财富创造的规律，只是代表着曲线最末端的一个点。这里存在一条守恒定律：如果你想赚 100 万美元，就得承受价值 100 万美元的痛苦。例如，一种赚 100 万美元的方式是在邮局工作一辈子，把每一分工资都存起来。想象一下在邮局工作 50 年的压力吧。而在创业公司，你把所有这些压力压缩到三四年里。批量承受痛苦确实能享受一定的 “折扣”，但你无法逃避这条基本守恒定律。如果创业很容易，那每个人都会去做。</p><p><strong>Millions, not Billions</strong></p><h3 id="百万，而非亿万"><a href="#百万，而非亿万" class="headerlink" title="百万，而非亿万"></a><strong>百万，而非亿万</strong></h3><p>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?</p><p>如果 300 万美元一年在某些人看来太高，在另一些人看来可能又太低。三百万？我怎么才能像比尔・盖茨那样成为亿万富翁？</p><p>So let’s get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It’s not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.</p><p>那我们现在就来说说比尔・盖茨。用著名的富豪举例不是个好主意，因为媒体只报道最富有的人，而这些人往往是特例。比尔・盖茨聪明、坚定且勤奋，但要赚他那么多钱，光靠这些还不够，你还需要非常幸运。</p><p>There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM’s side, Microsoft’s future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.</p><p>任何公司的成功都有很大的随机因素。所以，你最终在报纸上读到的那些人，都是既聪明、又全身心投入，还中了 “彩票” 的人。比尔当然聪明又专注，但微软也恰好受益于商业史上最惊人的失误之一：DOS 系统的授权协议。毫无疑问，比尔尽了全力促使 IBM 犯下这个错误，并且出色地利用了它。但如果 IBM 那边有一个脑子清醒的人，微软的未来会大不相同。在那个阶段，微软对 IBM 几乎没有影响力，实际上只是一个组件供应商。如果 IBM 要求独家授权（他们本该如此），微软还是会签下协议 —— 这仍然能给他们带来很多钱，而 IBM 也能轻易从别处弄到操作系统。</p><p>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.</p><p>结果却是，IBM 利用其在市场上的所有力量，让微软掌控了个人电脑的标准。从那时起，微软要做的只是执行：他们不必为大胆的决策赌上整个公司，只需对授权商采取强硬态度，并及时模仿更具创新性的产品。</p><p>If IBM hadn’t made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he’d be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.</p><p>如果 IBM 没有犯这个错，微软仍然会是一家成功的公司，但不可能成长得如此之快、如此之大。比尔・盖茨会很富有，但可能只是福布斯 400 富豪榜中与他同龄的那些人里排名靠后的一个。</p><p>There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.</p><p>致富的方式有很多，本文只讨论其中一种：通过创造财富并从中获得报酬来赚钱。其他方式还有很多，包括机遇、投机、婚姻、继承、盗窃、勒索、欺诈、垄断、贪污、游说、伪造和勘探。大多数巨额财富可能都涉及其中几种方式。</p><p>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it’s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it’s more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.</p><p>把创造财富作为致富方式的优势，不仅在于它更合法（其他很多方式现在都是非法的），还在于它更直接：你只需要做人们想要的事。</p><p><strong>Money Is Not Wealth</strong></p><h3 id="金钱不等同于财富"><a href="#金钱不等同于财富" class="headerlink" title="金钱不等同于财富"></a><strong>金钱不等同于财富</strong></h3><p>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.</p><p>如果你想创造财富，理解财富是什么会有帮助。财富和金钱不是一回事。[3] 财富和人类历史一样古老，实际上更古老 —— 蚂蚁都有财富。而金钱是相对较新的发明。</p><p>Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.</p><p>财富是根本。财富是我们想要的东西：食物、衣服、房子、汽车、 小工具、去有趣的地方旅行等等。你可以拥有财富而没有金钱。如果你有一台魔法机器，能按需为你变出汽车、做晚餐、洗衣服，或者做任何你想做的事，你就不需要金钱了。反之，如果你在南极腹地，没有东西可买，那么你有多少钱都没用。</p><p>Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money.</p><p>财富是你想要的东西，而不是金钱。但如果财富才是重要的，为什么每个人都在谈论赚钱呢？这是一种简略说法：金钱是转移财富的方式，实际上它们通常可以互换。但它们不是一回事，除非你打算通过伪造货币致富，否则谈论 “赚钱” 会让你更难理解如何创造财富。</p><p>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can’t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.</p><p>金钱是专业化的副产品。在一个专业化的社会里，你需要的大多数东西都无法自己制造。如果你想要一个土豆、一支铅笔或一个住处，你得从别人那里获得。</p><p>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can’t get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?</p><p>你如何让种土豆的人给你一些土豆？通过给他一些他想要的东西作为回报。但直接用东西和需要它们的人交换，你走不了多远。如果你制作小提琴，而当地农民没人想要，你该怎么吃饭？</p><p>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff– the medium of exchange– can be anything that’s rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we’ve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn’t physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p><p>随着社会越来越专业化，人们找到的解决方案是把交易变成两步流程。你不用小提琴直接换土豆，而是用小提琴换某种东西（比如银），然后再用这种东西换你需要的任何东西。这种中间物 —— 交换媒介 —— 可以是任何稀有且便携的东西。历史上，金属是最常见的，但最近我们一直在使用一种名为 “美元” 的交换媒介，它实际上并不存在物理形态。但它能作为交换媒介，是因为美国政府保证了它的稀有性。</p><p>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means. People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage– just a shorthand– for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want. [4]</p><p>交换媒介的优势是让交易得以进行，劣势是它往往掩盖了交易的真正意义。人们认为企业的作用是赚钱，但金钱只是中间阶段 —— 只是一种简略说法 —— 代表人们想要的任何东西。大多数企业真正做的是创造财富：它们做人们想要的事。[4]</p><p><strong>The Pie Fallacy</strong></p><h3 id="馅饼谬误"><a href="#馅饼谬误" class="headerlink" title="馅饼谬误"></a><strong>馅饼谬误</strong></h3><p>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that’s not the same thing.</p><p>令人惊讶的是，很多人从小就认为世界上的财富总量是固定的。在任何普通家庭中，某一时刻的金钱数量确实是固定的，但这和财富不是一回事。令人惊讶的是，很多人从小就认为世界上的财富总量是固定的。在任何普通家庭中，某一时刻的金钱数量确实是固定的，但这和财富不是一回事。</p><p>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. “You can’t make the pie larger,” say politicians. When you’re talking about the amount of money in one family’s bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year’s tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.</p><p>在这种语境下谈论财富时，人们常把它描述成一个馅饼。“你不能把馅饼做得更大，” 政客们说。当你谈论一个家庭银行账户里的钱，或者政府一年的税收收入时，这是对的：如果一个人多拿了，另一个人就必须少拿。</p><p>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you’re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.</p><p>我记得小时候曾认为，如果少数富人拥有所有的钱，留给其他人的就少了。很多人似乎到成年后仍然相信类似的说法。当你听到有人说 “x% 的人拥有 y% 的财富” 时，这种谬误往往就隐藏在背后。如果你打算创办一家创业公司，无论你是否意识到，你都是在计划推翻这种馅饼谬误。</p><p>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It’s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.</p><p>让人们误入歧途的是金钱的抽象性。金钱不是财富，它只是我们用来转移财富的工具。所以，尽管在某些特定时刻（比如你家这个月），可用来和别人交换你想要的东西的金钱数量是固定的，但世界上的财富总量并不是固定的。你可以创造更多财富。在整个人类历史中，财富一直在被创造和毁灭（但总体上是在被创造）。</p><p>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is– and you specifically are– one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you’ll get more for it.</p><p>假设你有一辆破旧的老车。明年夏天，你不用坐着无所事事，而是可以花时间把车修复到崭新的状态。在这个过程中，你创造了财富。世界 —— 特别是你 —— 因为多了一辆崭新的老车而变得更富有。而且这不只是比喻意义上的：如果你卖掉这辆车，能得到更多钱。</p><p>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven’t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. [5]</p><p>修复老车让你变得更富有，而没有让任何人变得更贫穷。所以很明显，财富不是固定的馅饼。事实上，这样想的话，你会奇怪为什么会有人认为财富是固定的。[5]</p><p>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don’t have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones– a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.</p><p>孩子们本能地知道自己可以创造财富，只是他们没意识到。如果你需要给别人送礼物却没有钱，你会自己做一个。但孩子们不擅长做东西，所以他们认为自制礼物和商店买的是完全不同的、更低等的东西 —— 只是那句老话 “心意最重要” 的一种表达。的确，我们为父母做的那些粗糙的烟灰缸，在二手市场上卖不出什么价钱。</p><p><strong>Craftsmen</strong></p><h3 id="工匠"><a href="#工匠" class="headerlink" title="工匠"></a><strong>工匠</strong></h3><p>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.</p><p>最有可能理解财富可以被创造的人，是那些擅长制作东西的人 —— 工匠。他们手工制作的东西变成了商店里售卖的商品。但随着工业化的兴起，工匠越来越少。现存最大的工匠群体之一是计算机程序员。</p><p>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn’t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer. [5b]</p><p>程序员可以坐在电脑前创造财富。一个好的软件本身就是有价值的东西，这里没有制造过程来混淆问题 —— 你输入的那些字符就是一个完整的、成品的产品。如果有人坐下来写一个不烂的网页浏览器（顺便说一句，这是个好主意），世界会因此变得更富有。[5b]</p><p>Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it’s clearer to programmers that wealth is something that’s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.</p><p>公司里的每个人都在共同创造财富，也就是制造更多人们想要的东西。很多员工（比如邮件收发室或人事部的人）的工作与实际制造东西有一层隔阂，但程序员不是。他们真的是一行一行地 “思考” 出产品。因此，程序员更清楚财富是被创造出来的，而不是像想象中的 “爸爸” 分馅饼那样被分配的。</p><p>It’s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).</p><p>程序员也很清楚，财富创造的速度存在巨大差异。在 Viaweb，我们有一位程序员，他的生产力高得惊人。我记得有一天看他工作了一整天，估算他为公司增加了几十万美元的市值。一个优秀的程序员在状态好的时候，几周内就能创造 100 万美元的财富。而一个平庸的程序员在同样的时间里，可能创造零甚至负的财富（比如引入漏洞）。</p><p>This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth– undergraduates, reporters, politicians– hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.</p><p>这就是为什么很多最优秀的程序员是自由主义者。在我们的世界里，你要么成功，要么失败，没有借口。那些远离财富创造的人 —— 大学生、记者、政客 —— 听到 “最富有的 5% 的人拥有一半的财富” 时，往往会认为这是不公！而有经验的程序员更可能想：“才这么点？” 最顶尖的 5% 的程序员可能写出了 99% 的优秀软件。</p><p>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we’re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I’m running on the computer I’m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.</p><p>财富可以在不被出售的情况下被创造。至少直到最近，科学家创造的财富实际上是捐赠出去的。我们都因为知道青霉素而变得更富有，因为我们死于感染的可能性更小了。财富是人们想要的任何东西，而 “不死亡” 显然是我们想要的。黑客经常通过编写开源软件来捐赠自己的工作，任何人都可以免费使用。我因为 FreeBSD 操作系统而变得更富有（我现在用的电脑就运行着它），雅虎也是如此 —— 他们所有的服务器都在运行它。</p><p><strong>What a Job Is</strong></p><h3 id="工作是什么"><a href="#工作是什么" class="headerlink" title="工作是什么"></a><strong>工作是什么</strong></h3><p>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.</p><p>在工业化国家，人们至少在二十几岁前都属于某个机构。多年以后，你会习惯这种归属感：一群人早上起床，去某些建筑里，做一些他们通常不喜欢做的事。属于这样的群体成了你的身份标签：姓名、年龄、角色、机构。如果你必须自我介绍，或者别人描述你时，会说 “约翰・史密斯，10 岁，某小学学生”，或者 “约翰・史密斯，20 岁，某大学学生”。</p><p>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it’s a lot like college. You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.</p><p>约翰・史密斯毕业后，人们期望他找一份工作。而找工作似乎意味着加入另一个机构。表面上看，这和大学很像：你挑选想为之工作的公司，申请加入。如果有一家公司喜欢你，你就成了这个新群体的一员。你早上起床，去新的建筑里，做一些你通常不喜欢做的事。有几个不同之处：生活没那么有趣，而且你会得到报酬，而不是像在大学时那样付钱。但相似之处似乎比不同之处更多。约翰・史密斯现在成了 “约翰・史密斯，22 岁，某公司软件开发者”。</p><p>In fact John Smith’s life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.</p><p>事实上，约翰・史密斯的生活变化比他意识到的要大。从社交角度看，公司和大学很像，但越深入底层现实，差异就越大。</p><p>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don’t make anything physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.</p><p>公司要做的（而且如果想继续存在就必须做的）是赚钱。大多数公司赚钱的方式是创造财富。公司可能非常专业化，以至于这种相似性被掩盖了，但不只是制造公司在创造财富。财富的一个重要组成部分是 “位置”。还记得那台能给你变出汽车、做晚餐等等的魔法机器吗？如果它把晚餐送到中亚的某个随机地点，就没那么有用了。如果财富是人们想要的东西，那么运输东西的公司也在创造财富。其他很多不制造实体产品的公司也是如此。几乎所有公司的存在都是为了做人们想要的事。</p><p>And that’s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people’s. You may not even be aware you’re doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won’t make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.</p><p>当你为一家公司工作时，你做的也是这件事。但这里有另一层因素掩盖了底层现实：在公司里，你的工作与很多其他人的工作被平均了。你甚至可能没意识到自己在做人们想要的事，你的贡献可能是间接的。但整个公司必须给人们提供他们想要的东西，否则就赚不到钱。如果公司每年付给你 x 美元，那么平均来看，你必须贡献至少 x 美元价值的工作，否则公司会入不敷出，最终倒闭。</p><p>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don’t need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It’s doing something people want that matters, not joining the group. [6]</p><p>大学毕业生会想（而且别人也会告诉他），他需要找一份工作，仿佛重要的是成为某个机构的一员。更直接的说法是：你需要开始做人们想要的事。你不需要加入公司才能做到这一点。公司只不过是一群人为了做人们想要的事而一起工作的组织。重要的是做人们想要的事，而不是加入这个群体。[6]</p><p>For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what’s happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.</p><p>对大多数人来说，最好的计划可能是为现有的公司工作。但理解你这么做时发生了什么是有好处的：工作意味着做人们想要的事，只不过是和公司里的其他人的工作平均在一起。</p><p><strong>Working Harder</strong></p><h3 id="更努力地工作"><a href="#更努力地工作" class="headerlink" title="更努力地工作"></a><strong>更努力地工作</strong></h3><p>That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person’s work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You’re expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you’re not expected to devote your whole life to your work.</p><p>这种 “平均” 成了一个问题。我认为大公司面临的最大问题是，很难衡量每个员工的工作价值。在很大程度上，他们只能敷衍了事。在大公司里，你努力工作，就能得到一份相当可预测的薪水。人们期望你不要明显无能或懒惰，但不期望你把全部生活都投入工作。</p><p>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.</p><p>然而，事实证明，你投入工作的时间多少，存在规模经济效应。在合适的行业里，一个全身心投入工作的人创造的财富，可能是普通员工的 10 倍甚至 100 倍。例如，一个程序员如果不只是慢慢维护和更新现有软件，而是编写一个全新的软件，就能创造新的收入来源。</p><p>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can’t go to your boss and say, I’d like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.</p><p>但公司的机制并不奖励想这么做的人。你不能走到老板面前说：“我想努力 10 倍，所以请付我 10 倍的薪水。” 一方面，官方的说法是你已经在尽最大努力工作了；但更严重的问题是，公司无法衡量你的工作价值。</p><p>Salesmen are an exception. It’s easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they’re usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.</p><p>销售人员是个例外。衡量他们创造的收入很容易，而且他们的报酬通常是收入的一定比例。如果销售人员想更努力工作，他可以直接开始做，报酬也会自动成比例增加。</p><p>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee’s performance can’t usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he’s done badly.</p><p>除了销售，大公司还有一种岗位能雇到顶尖人才：高层管理岗位。原因相同：他们的绩效可以被衡量。高层管理者要对整个公司的绩效负责。普通员工的绩效通常无法衡量，所以人们不期望他们付出更多，只需要扎实努力。而高层管理者和销售人员一样，必须拿出实际成果。如果公司业绩下滑，CEO 不能辩解说自己已经扎实努力了 —— 公司做得不好，就是他做得不好。</p><p>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.</p><p>一家能如此直接地给所有员工付薪的公司，会非常成功。很多员工如果能因此获得更多报酬，就会更努力工作。更重要的是，这样的公司会吸引那些想特别努力工作的人，从而击败竞争对手。</p><p>Unfortunately, companies can’t pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees’ work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it’s something they’ve got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget’s sales are due to each group’s efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There’s no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you’d find these factors were all blurred together.</p><p>不幸的是，公司不能像对待销售人员那样给所有员工付薪。销售人员是独立工作的，而大多数员工的工作是相互交织的。假设一家公司生产某种消费电子产品：工程师造出了功能可靠、有各种新特性的产品；工业设计师为它设计了漂亮的外壳；然后营销人员说服所有人这是他们必须拥有的东西。你怎么知道产品的销量有多少归功于每个团队的努力？或者，有多少归功于过去的产品为公司赢得的质量声誉？你无法理清所有这些贡献。即使你能读懂消费者的心思，也会发现这些因素都是交织在一起的。</p><p>If you want to go faster, it’s a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people’s. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable– and the rest of the group slows you down.</p><p>如果你想加快速度，那么当你的工作与大量其他人的工作交织在一起时，就是个问题。在大团队中，你的绩效无法单独衡量 —— 而且团队中的其他人会拖慢你的速度。</p><p><strong>Measurement and Leverage</strong></p><h3 id="衡量与杠杆"><a href="#衡量与杠杆" class="headerlink" title="衡量与杠杆"></a><strong>衡量与杠杆</strong></h3><p>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.</p><p>要致富，你需要处于一种同时具备 “衡量” 和 “杠杆” 的环境中。你需要处于一个能衡量你绩效的位置，否则无法通过多做工作来获得更多报酬。而且你必须有杠杆，也就是说，你做的决策能产生巨大影响。</p><p>Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.</p><p>仅有衡量是不够的。例如，血汗工厂里的计件工作有衡量，但没有杠杆。你的绩效被衡量，报酬也相应计算，但你没有决策空间。你唯一能做的决定是工作速度，而这可能最多只能让你的收入增加两三倍。</p><p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</p><p>同时具备衡量和杠杆的工作例子是电影的主角。你的绩效可以通过电影的票房来衡量，而你的表现能决定电影的成败，这就是杠杆。</p><p>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They’re measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.</p><p>CEO 也同时具备衡量和杠杆。他们的绩效通过公司的业绩来衡量，而他们的决策能让整个公司朝着某个方向发展，这就是杠杆。</p><p>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they’re out. If you’re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.</p><p>我认为，所有靠自己努力致富的人，都会处于一个同时具备衡量和杠杆的环境中。我能想到的所有人都是如此：CEO、电影明星、对冲基金经理、职业运动员。杠杆存在的一个很好的迹象是 “失败的可能性”。收益必须与风险平衡，所以如果有巨大的潜在收益，就一定有可怕的潜在损失。CEO、明星、基金经理和运动员都生活在 “达摩克利斯之剑” 下 —— 一旦表现下滑，就会被淘汰。如果你从事的工作感觉很安全，你就不会致富，因为如果没有风险，几乎可以肯定没有杠杆。</p><p>But you don’t have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.</p><p>但你不必成为 CEO 或电影明星才能处于这样的环境中。你只需要加入一个致力于解决难题的小团队。</p><p><strong>Smallness &#x3D; Measurement</strong></p><h3 id="小规模-可衡量"><a href="#小规模-可衡量" class="headerlink" title="小规模 &#x3D; 可衡量"></a><strong>小规模 &#x3D; 可衡量</strong></h3><p>If you can’t measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.</p><p>如果你无法衡量单个员工的工作价值，你可以接近这个目标：衡量小团队的工作价值。</p><p>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.</p><p>衡量员工创造的收入的一个层面是整个公司的层面。当公司规模小时，你就能相当接近地衡量单个员工的贡献。一家能存活的创业公司可能只有 10 名员工，这样你对个人努力的衡量误差就在 10 倍以内。</p><p>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one’s boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two differences: you’re not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you’re not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.</p><p>因此，创办或加入创业公司，是大多数人能接近 “对老板说‘我想努力 10 倍，所以请付我 10 倍薪水’” 的方式。有两个区别：你不是对老板说，而是直接对客户说（毕竟老板只是客户的代理）；而且你不是单独行动，而是和一小群同样有野心的人一起。</p><p>It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can’t be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it’s their work that yours is going to be averaged with.</p><p>通常来说，这会是一个团队。除了少数特殊工作（如演戏或写书），你不可能一个人组成一家公司。而且你共事的人最好很优秀，因为你的工作价值会和他们的平均在一起。</p><p>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.</p><p>大公司就像一艘由一千名划手驱动的巨型帆船。有两件事会拖慢帆船的速度：一是划手们看不到努力工作的结果；二是在一千人的团队中，划手的平均水平很可能就是普通水平。</p><p>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.</p><p>如果你从这艘大帆船上随机选出 10 个人，让他们自己驾一艘小船，他们可能会划得更快。他们既有胡萝卜（奖励）也有大棒（惩罚）来激励自己。一个精力充沛的划手会因为知道自己能对船速产生明显影响而受到鼓舞；而如果有人懒惰，其他人更可能注意到并抱怨。</p><p>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It’s a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.</p><p>但 10 人小船的真正优势，体现在当你把大帆船上最优秀的 10 名划手挑出来，让他们一起驾一艘船时。他们会拥有小团队带来的所有额外动力，更重要的是，通过挑选这么小的团队，你能得到最优秀的划手。每个人都会是前 1% 的水平。对他们来说，和一小群同行的工作平均在一起，比和所有人的平均在一起要好得多。</p><p>That’s the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.</p><p>这就是创业公司的真正意义。理想情况下，你和一群同样想比在大公司更努力工作、获得更多报酬的人一起奋斗。而且因为创业公司往往是由一群自我选择的、有野心的人创办的（他们至少通过声誉相互了解），其衡量的精确性比单纯的小规模更高。创业公司不只是 10 个人，而是 10 个像你一样的人。</p><p>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If anything, it’s more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select. You don’t want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.</p><p>史蒂夫・乔布斯曾说，创业公司的成败取决于最初的 10 名员工。我同意。甚至可以说，更像是最初的 5 名。小规模本身并不是创业公司成功的原因，而是小团队可以做到 “精选”。你想要的不是 “乡村式” 的小规模，而是 “全明星队式” 的小规模。</p><p>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole. So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.</p><p>团队越大，其平均成员的水平就越接近总体人口的平均水平。所以，在其他条件相同的情况下，大公司里的优秀人才很可能吃亏，因为他们的表现被其他人的较低表现拉低了。当然，其他条件往往不相同：优秀人才可能不在乎钱，或者更喜欢大公司的稳定性。但在乎钱的优秀人才，通常会更愿意离开，和一小群同行一起工作。</p><p><strong>Technology &#x3D; Leverage</strong></p><h3 id="技术-杠杆"><a href="#技术-杠杆" class="headerlink" title="技术 &#x3D; 杠杆"></a><strong>技术 &#x3D; 杠杆</strong></h3><p>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they’re small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.</p><p>创业公司为任何人提供了一种处于 “可衡量” 和 “有杠杆” 环境中的方式。它们因规模小而具备可衡量性，因通过发明新技术赚钱而具备杠杆。</p><p>What is technology? It’s technique. It’s the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That’s the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That’s leverage.</p><p>什么是技术？是技术方法，是我们做事的方式。当你发现一种新的做事方式时，它的价值会被所有使用它的人放大。这就像那句谚语说的 “授人以鱼不如授人以渔”。这就是创业公司与餐馆或理发店的区别：你炸薯条或剪头发，一次只能服务一个客户；而如果你解决了一个很多人关心的技术问题，你就帮助了所有使用你解决方案的人 —— 这就是杠杆。</p><p>If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can’t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.</p><p>纵观历史，大多数通过创造财富致富的人，都是通过开发新技术做到的。你不可能以足够快的速度炸薯条或剪头发来致富。1200 年让佛罗伦萨人富起来的，是他们发现了制造当时的高科技产品 —— 精细织布 —— 的新技术；1600 年让荷兰人富起来的，是他们发现了造船和航海技术，使他们能主导远东的海洋贸易。</p><p>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that’s valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don’t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.</p><p>幸运的是，小规模和解决难题之间存在天然的契合。技术的前沿变化很快：今天有价值的技术，可能几年后就一文不值。小公司更适合这种环境，因为它们没有层层官僚机构拖慢速度。此外，技术进步往往来自非正统的方法，而小公司受传统的约束更少。</p><p>Big companies can develop technology. They just can’t do it quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.</p><p>大公司也能开发技术，但就是快不起来。它们的规模让它们行动迟缓，而且无法奖励员工付出的非凡努力。因此，实际上，大公司只能在那些需要大量资本、让创业公司无法竞争的领域（如微处理器、发电厂或客机）开发技术。即便在这些领域，它们也严重依赖创业公司提供的组件和想法。</p><p>It’s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don’t seem to be about technology. McDonald’s, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald’s franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald’s franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.</p><p>生物技术或软件创业公司为解决棘手技术问题而存在，这很明显。但我认为，在那些看似与技术无关的行业中，情况也是如此。例如，麦当劳能发展壮大，是因为它设计了一套系统 —— 麦当劳特许经营模式 —— 这套系统可以在世界各地随意复制。麦当劳的特许经营受到极其精确的规则控制，几乎就像一个软件：“一次编写，到处运行”。沃尔玛也是如此。山姆・沃尔顿致富，不是因为他是零售商，而是因为他设计了一种新的商店模式。</p><p>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.</p><p>不仅在选择公司的总体目标时，而且在沿途的每个决策点，都要用 “难度” 作为指导。在 Viaweb，我们有一个经验法则：“跑上楼”。假设你是一个灵活的小个子，被一个又胖又壮的恶霸追赶。你打开一扇门，发现自己在楼梯口。你会上楼还是下楼？我说上楼。恶霸跑下楼可能和你一样快，但上楼时，他的体重会成为更大的劣势。上楼对你来说很难，但对他来说更难。</p><p>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we’d always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can’t follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem. And I’d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.</p><p>在实践中，这意味着我们故意去寻找难题。如果有两个功能可以添加到我们的软件中，两者的价值与难度之比相同，我们总会选择更难的那个。不仅因为它更有价值，还因为它更难。我们乐于迫使更大、更慢的竞争对手跟着我们越过艰难的领域。就像游击队一样，创业公司更喜欢山区的复杂地形，因为中央政府的军队无法跟上。我记得有好几次，我们在一整天都在与某个可怕的技术问题搏斗后筋疲力尽，但我会很高兴，因为对我们来说很难的事情，对竞争对手来说可能是不可能的。</p><p>This is not just a good way to run a startup. It’s what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry. If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he’ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop? That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? [7] And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they’ll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they’ll take away your market overnight. You’d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.</p><p>这不仅是经营创业公司的好方法，这就是创业公司的本质。风险投资家知道这一点，他们有一个说法：“进入壁垒”。如果你带着一个新想法去找风险投资家，请求投资，他首先会问的问题之一是：“其他人开发这个有多难？” 也就是说，你在自己和潜在的追赶者之间设置了多少艰难的障碍？[7] 而且你最好能有说服力地解释为什么你的技术难以复制。否则，一旦大公司注意到它，就会自己开发，凭借他们的品牌、资本和分销渠道，一夜之间夺走你的市场。你就会像在开阔地带被正规军抓住的游击队一样。</p><p>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can’t, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it’s an everyday thing for them. They’ll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented television. The reason you’ve never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it. [8] The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth’s reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.</p><p>设置进入壁垒的一种方式是通过专利，但专利可能提供不了多少保护。竞争对手通常能找到绕过专利的方法；如果绕不过，他们可能会直接侵权，然后等你来起诉。大公司不怕被起诉 —— 这对他们来说是家常便饭。他们会确保起诉他们既昂贵又耗时。你听说过菲洛・法恩斯沃思吗？他发明了电视。你没听说过他，是因为他的公司没有从电视中赚钱。[8] 赚钱的是 RCA，而法恩斯沃思的回报是长达十年的专利诉讼。</p><p>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that’s simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don’t need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. [9]</p><p>在这里，就像在很多情况下一样，最好的防御是主动进攻。如果你能开发出竞争对手根本无法复制的技术，你就不需要依赖其他防御手段。从选择一个难题开始，然后在每个决策点，都选择更难的选项。[9]</p><p><strong>The Catch(es)</strong></p><h3 id="陷阱"><a href="#陷阱" class="headerlink" title="陷阱"></a><strong>陷阱</strong></h3><p>If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it would be more fun. I don’t think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.</p><p>如果创业只是比普通员工更努力工作，然后按比例获得报酬，那创办创业公司显然是个好主意。在某种程度上，这会更有趣。我认为很多人不喜欢大公司的慢节奏、没完没了的会议、茶水间的闲聊、愚蠢的中层经理等等。</p><p>Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can’t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can’t decide, for example, that you’d like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When you’re running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.</p><p>不幸的是，这里有几个陷阱。一是你无法选择自己想处于曲线的哪个点。例如，你不能决定自己想努力两三倍，然后获得相应的报酬。当你经营一家创业公司时，你的竞争对手会决定你要多努力工作 —— 而他们几乎都会做出同样的决定：尽你所能。</p><p>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you’re 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you’re 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble. It’s common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.</p><p>另一个陷阱是，报酬平均来看才与生产力成比例。正如我之前所说，任何公司的成功都有很大的随机乘数。所以实际上，情况不是 “你生产力是 30 倍，报酬也是 30 倍”，而是 “你生产力是 30 倍，报酬在 0 到 1000 倍之间”。如果平均值是 30 倍，中位数可能就是 0。大多数创业公司都会失败，而且不只是我们在互联网泡沫时期听说的那些 “狗粮门户网站”。一家创业公司可能正在开发真正好的产品，但开发时间稍长，资金耗尽，就不得不关门。</p><p>A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.</p><p>创业公司就像蚊子。熊能承受一击，螃蟹有盔甲保护，但蚊子的设计目的只有一个：得分。它不会在防御上浪费能量。蚊子作为一个物种的防御方式是数量众多，但这对单个蚊子来说没什么安慰。</p><p>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don’t generally know which of the two you’re going to get till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.</p><p>创业公司和蚊子一样，往往是 “要么全有，要么全无” 的命题。而且你通常要到最后一刻才知道自己会是哪一种。Viaweb 有好几次差点失败，我们的轨迹就像正弦波。幸运的是，我们在周期的顶端被收购了，但真的非常接近失败。当我们在加州拜访雅虎，商谈把公司卖给他们时，我们还得借一个会议室，向一位即将退出新一轮融资的投资者保证我们能活下去（我们需要这笔融资来维持运营）。</p><p>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb’s hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.</p><p>这种 “全有或全无” 的特性不是我们想要的。Viaweb 的黑客们都极其厌恶风险。如果有某种方式能让我们只拼命工作，然后获得相应报酬，而不掺杂任何 “彩票” 性质，我们会很高兴。我们宁愿有 100% 的机会得到 100 万美元，也不愿有 20% 的机会得到 1000 万美元 —— 尽管理论上后者的价值是前者的两倍。不幸的是，目前商业世界中没有这样的机会。</p><p>The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.</p><p>最接近的方式是在早期阶段卖掉你的创业公司，放弃潜在收益（和风险），换取一笔较小但有保证的回报。我们有过这样的机会，但当时愚蠢地错过了。在那之后，我们变得非常渴望被收购。在接下来的一年左右，只要有人对 Viaweb 表现出丝毫兴趣，我们就会试图把公司卖给他们。但没有人愿意买，所以我们不得不继续做下去。</p><p>It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.</p><p>在早期阶段收购我们本是很划算的，但进行收购的公司并不想捡便宜。大到足以收购创业公司的公司，通常也保守到足以让收购负责人（他们很可能是商学院出身、后期加入公司的人）在收购决策上更保守。他们宁愿为 “安全的选择” 多付钱。因此，收购一家成熟的创业公司（即使溢价很高），也比收购一家早期创业公司更容易。</p><p><strong>Get Users</strong></p><h3 id="获取用户"><a href="#获取用户" class="headerlink" title="获取用户"></a><strong>获取用户</strong></h3><p>I think it’s a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It’s also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client’s assets into one volatile stock?</p><p>我认为如果可能的话，被收购是个好主意。经营企业和发展企业是两回事。一旦达到稳定阶段，让大公司接手也无妨。从财务角度看，出售公司也更明智，因为这能让你实现多元化。如果一个财务顾问把客户的所有资产都投入一只波动剧烈的股票，你会怎么想？</p><p>How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you’d do if you didn’t intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.</p><p>如何让公司被收购？大多数情况下，你要做的和不打算出售公司时做的事情一样，比如盈利。但被收购本身也是一门艺术，我们花了很多时间试图掌握它。</p><p>Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don’t buy you now, you’ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.</p><p>潜在的收购方总会尽可能拖延。被收购的难点在于让他们采取行动。对大多数人来说，最强大的动机不是对收益的希望，而是对损失的恐惧。对潜在收购方来说，最强大的动机是担心竞争对手会收购你。正如我们发现的，这会让 CEO 们连夜赶路。第二大动机是担心：如果现在不收购你，你会继续快速成长，以后收购成本更高，甚至可能成为竞争对手。</p><p>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. You’d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.</p><p>在这两种情况下，归根结底都是 “用户”。你可能会认为，打算收购你的公司会做大量研究，自己判断你的技术有多有价值。根本不是这样。他们只看你有多少用户。</p><p>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you’ve created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren’t using your software, maybe it’s not just because you’re bad at marketing. Maybe it’s because you haven’t made what they want.</p><p>实际上，收购方假设客户知道谁拥有最好的技术。这并不像听起来那么愚蠢。用户是你创造了财富的唯一真正证明。财富是人们想要的东西，如果人们不使用你的软件，可能不只是因为你营销做得不好，还可能是因为你没有做出他们想要的东西。</p><p>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you’re not just trying to solve problems. You’re trying to solve problems that users care about.</p><p>风险投资家有一份需要警惕的危险信号清单，其中靠前的是 “被技术迷经营的公司，他们痴迷于解决有趣的技术问题，而不是让用户满意”。在创业公司里，你不只是要解决问题，还要解决用户关心的问题。</p><p>So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.</p><p>所以我认为，你应该像收购方那样，把用户作为检验标准。把创业公司视为一个优化问题，其绩效用用户数量来衡量。任何试图优化软件的人都知道，关键在于衡量。当你试图猜测程序哪里慢、如何让它更快时，几乎总是猜错。</p><p>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It’s what acquirers care about. It’s what revenues depend on. It’s what makes competitors unhappy. It’s what impresses reporters, and potential new users. Certainly it’s a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.</p><p>用户数量可能不是完美的检验标准，但会非常接近。这是收购方关心的，是收入的基础，是让竞争对手不快的原因，是给记者和潜在新用户留下深刻印象的东西。当然，无论你技术多娴熟，它都比你凭直觉判断 “哪些问题值得解决” 要好得多。</p><p>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly– taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you’re optimizing based on guesses.</p><p>把创业公司视为优化问题，还能帮助你避免风险投资家担心的另一个陷阱 —— 开发产品耗时过长。现在我们可以意识到，这是黑客们已经知道要避免的：过早优化。尽快推出 1.0 版本。在你有用户可以衡量之前，你的优化都是基于猜测。</p><p>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear “your call is important to us, please stay on the line,” do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?</p><p>你需要时刻牢记的核心原则是：财富就是人们想要的东西。如果你打算通过创造财富来致富，就必须知道人们想要什么。很少有企业真正注重让客户满意。你有多少次走进一家商店，或者给一家公司打电话时，心里隐隐感到一丝不安？当你听到 “您的来电对我们很重要，请耐心等待” 时，会觉得 “太好了，一切都会好起来” 吗？</p><p>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that’s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.</p><p>一家餐馆偶尔提供一份烤焦的晚餐，或许还能承受。但在技术领域，你 “烹饪” 出一份东西，所有人都得吃这一份。所以，你提供的东西与人们想要的东西之间的任何差距，都会被无限放大。你要么让所有客户满意，要么惹恼所有客户。你越能贴近人们的需求，创造的财富就越多。</p><p><strong>Wealth and Power</strong></p><h3 id="财富与权力"><a href="#财富与权力" class="headerlink" title="财富与权力"></a><strong>财富与权力</strong></h3><p>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</p><p>创造财富并非致富的唯一途径。在人类历史的大部分时间里，它甚至不是最常见的途径。直到几个世纪前，财富的主要来源还是矿山、奴隶与农奴、土地和牲畜，而快速获取这些财富的方式只有继承、婚姻、征服或没收。财富自然名声不佳。</p><p>Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world’s history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds’ lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.</p><p>两件事改变了这一切。首先是法治。在世界历史的大部分时间里，如果你好不容易积累了一笔财富，统治者或其爪牙总会想办法把它夺走。但在中世纪的欧洲，一些新的变化出现了：一个新的商人和制造商阶层开始在城镇聚集。[10] 他们联合起来，有能力对抗当地的封建领主。于是，在人类历史上第一次，恶霸们不再抢走 “书呆子” 的午餐钱了。这自然形成了强大的激励，或许也正是第二次重大变革 —— 工业化 —— 的主要原因。</p><p>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.</p><p>关于工业革命的起因，已有大量论述。但可以肯定的是，一个必要（即便不是充分）条件是：让创造财富的人能够安心享受自己的财富。[11] 有一个证据可以说明这一点：那些试图回归旧模式的国家（如苏联），以及在较小程度上 20 世纪 60 年代至 70 年代初工党执政的英国，都发生了类似的情况。一旦剥夺了财富带来的激励，技术创新就会陷入停滞。</p><p>Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They’re willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they’re not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate boss that you can’t go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.</p><p>记住，从经济角度看，创业公司的本质是：一种 “我想更快地工作” 的宣言。你不想通过五十年的固定工资慢慢积累财富，而是想尽快完成这件事。因此，禁止你积累财富的政府，实际上是在命令你放慢工作节奏。他们愿意让你在五十年里赚 300 万美元，却不愿让你通过拼命工作在两年内做到这一点。这就像你无法走到公司老板面前说 “我想努力十倍，请付我十倍薪水” 一样 —— 只不过，这个 “老板” 你无法通过创办自己的公司来逃离。</p><p>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It’s that it tends not to happen at all. It’s only when you’re deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.</p><p>工作节奏缓慢的问题，不仅在于技术创新的速度会变慢，更在于创新可能根本不会发生。只有当你刻意去寻找难题，以利用速度获得最大优势时，才会承担这类项目。开发新技术是件苦差事。正如爱迪生所说，它是 1% 的灵感加 99% 的汗水。没有财富的激励，没人愿意做这件事。工程师会为战斗机、月球火箭等 “酷炫” 项目拿普通薪水工作，但灯泡、半导体等更平凡的技术，必须靠企业家来开发。</p><p>Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.</p><p>创业公司并非只是过去几十年硅谷才有的新鲜事物。自从通过创造财富可以致富以来，所有以此致富的人都使用了本质相同的方法：衡量与杠杆 —— 衡量来自小团队协作，杠杆来自新技术的开发。1200 年的佛罗伦萨与如今的圣克拉拉（硅谷所在地），使用的是同一个配方。</p><p>Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.</p><p>理解这一点或许有助于回答一个重要问题：欧洲为何变得如此强大？是因为欧洲的地理优势吗？是因为欧洲人在种族上更优越吗？还是因为他们的宗教？答案（至少直接原因）可能是：欧洲人搭乘了一个强大的新思想浪潮 —— 允许那些赚大钱的人保留自己的财富。</p><p>Once you’re allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn’t have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn’t have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.</p><p>一旦允许人们这样做，想致富的人就可以通过创造财富而非掠夺来实现目标。由此带来的技术进步，不仅转化为财富，还转化为军事力量。隐形飞机的理论由一位苏联数学家提出，但由于苏联没有计算机产业，这一理论对他们而言始终只是理论 —— 他们没有足够快的硬件来执行计算，无法设计出实际的飞机。</p><p>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don’t let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.</p><p>从这个角度看，冷战与二战（以及近代史上的大多数战争）都传递了同一个教训：不要让由战士和政客组成的统治阶级打压企业家。让个人致富的方法，同样能让国家强大。让 “书呆子” 保住自己的午餐钱，你就能统治世界。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is uninterruptability. Different kinds of work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.</p><p>[1] 创业公司能给你带来的一个宝贵特质，是<strong>不受干扰的工作状态</strong>。不同类型的工作有不同的 “时间量子”：校对文稿的人或许每 15 分钟被打断一次， productivity（生产力）也不会受太大影响；但黑客（程序员）的时间量子很长 —— 可能需要整整一小时，才能把一个问题 “加载” 进大脑。因此，人事部的人打电话来提醒你忘了填某张表格，造成的损失可能极大。</p><p>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.</p><p>这就是为什么当黑客从屏幕前转过身来回答你的问题时，会投来如此凶狠的目光 —— 他们脑海中那座巨大的 “纸牌屋” 正在摇摇欲坠。</p><p>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it’s next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).</p><p>仅仅是 “可能被打断” 的风险，就会让黑客不敢开始攻克难题。这也是他们倾向于在深夜工作的原因，也是为什么在格子间里几乎写不出优秀的软件（除非在深夜）。</p><p>One great advantage of startups is that they don’t yet have any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.</p><p>创业公司的一大优势在于，还没有那些会打断你的人。这里没有人事部，因此也就没有那些表格，更没人会为此给你打电话。</p><p>[2] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.</p><p>[2] 面对 “创业公司员工的生产力可能是大公司员工的 20 到 30 倍” 这一说法，大公司的高管们自然会想：我怎样才能让手下的人也做到这一点？答案很简单：<strong>按生产力给他们付薪</strong>。</p><p>Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?</p><p>大多数公司的内部运作就像共产主义国家。如果你信奉自由市场，为什么不把公司改造成一个自由市场呢？</p><p>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.</p><p>假设：当每个员工的薪酬与他们创造的财富成正比时，公司的利润能达到最大化。</p><p>[3] Until recently even governments sometimes didn’t grasp the distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their “wealth” by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.</p><p>[3] 直到最近，即便是政府有时也分不清金钱与财富的区别。亚当・斯密在《国富论》（第五篇第一章）中提到，有一些国家试图通过禁止黄金或白银出口来 “保护” 它们的 “财富”。但拥有更多的交换媒介（货币）并不会让一个国家更富有 —— 如果更多的钱追逐等量的物质财富，结果只会是物价上涨。</p><p>[4] There are many senses of the word “wealth,” not all of them material. I’m not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind. I’m writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word “wealth.” What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.</p><p>[4] “财富” 一词有很多含义，并非都与物质相关。我不想在这里深入探讨哲学层面的 “哪种财富才是真正的财富”，而是聚焦于一个特定的、偏技术层面的定义：<strong>人们愿意为之付钱的东西</strong>。这种财富值得研究，因为它能让你免于挨饿。而人们愿意为哪些东西付钱，取决于他们，而非你。</p><p>When you’re starting a business, it’s easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an “outdoor portal.” You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.</p><p>创业时，你很容易陷入一种误区：认为客户想要的是你喜欢的东西。互联网泡沫时期，我曾遇到一位女士，她因为喜欢户外活动，就创办了一个 “户外门户网站”。但你知道吗？如果你喜欢户外活动，应该创办的是数据恢复公司 —— 帮人找回崩溃硬盘里的数据。</p><p>What’s the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what’s valuable is least likely to coincide with other people’s.</p><p>这两者有什么关联？毫无关联。这恰恰是我的观点：如果你想创造财富（从 “不挨饿” 这个狭义的技术角度来说），就应该对任何以 “自己喜欢” 为核心的计划保持高度怀疑。在这类事情上，你对 “价值” 的判断最不可能与他人一致。</p><p>[5] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don’t make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a machine that’s broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.</p><p>[5] 在修复汽车的过程中，你可能会对环境造成微小破坏，从而让其他人变得 “微乎其微地更穷”。虽然环境成本应该被考虑在内，但这并不会让财富变成一场零和游戏。例如，如果你修理一台因某个零件松动而坏掉的机器，就是在不产生环境成本的情况下创造财富。</p><p>[5b] This essay was written before Firefox.</p><p>[5b] 本文撰写于 Firefox 浏览器出现之前。</p><p>[6] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don’t be fooled by the surface similarities. You’ve gone from guest to servant. It’s possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say “authorized personnel only.” But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you’re not consciously aware of it.</p><p>[6] 很多人在二十出头时会感到迷茫和沮丧。大学时光似乎有趣得多 —— 当然是这样。不要被表面的相似性所迷惑：你已经从 “客人” 变成了 “仆人”。在这个新世界里依然可以找到乐趣，比如，你现在能走进那些标着 “仅限授权人员进入” 的门。但这种转变起初会让人震惊，如果你没有清醒地意识到这一点，冲击会更大。</p><p>[7] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn’t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.</p><p>[7] 当年风投问我们，其他创业公司需要多久才能复制我们的软件时，我们总回答 “他们可能根本做不到”。现在想来，这让我们显得要么天真，要么像骗子。</p><p>[8] Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the “inventor” of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company’s PR people worked hard to spread the story. If you don’t know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it’s because other companies made all the money.</p><p>[8] 很少有技术能明确归属于某一个发明者。因此，通常来说，如果你知道某样东西（电话、流水线、飞机、灯泡、晶体管）的 “发明者” 是谁，那是因为他们的公司从中赚了钱，并且公司的公关人员不遗余力地传播了这个故事。如果你不知道某样东西（汽车、电视、计算机、喷气发动机、激光）的发明者是谁，那是因为钱都被其他公司赚走了。</p><p>[9] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you’re trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you’re even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what’s the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.</p><p>[9] 这是一个适用于生活的好原则：<strong>面对两个选择时，选更难的那个</strong>。比如，当你纠结于出去跑步还是在家看电视时，选跑步。这个原则之所以有效，可能是因为当两个选择中一个更难时，你会考虑另一个的唯一原因就是懒惰。你内心深处知道该做什么，而这个原则只是迫使你承认这一点。</p><p>[10] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.</p><p>[10] 中产阶级最早出现在意大利北部和低地国家（荷兰、比利时等）并非偶然 —— 这些地区没有强大的中央政府。这两个地区是当时最富有的地方，也成为文艺复兴文明辐射的双中心。如今它们不再扮演这一角色，是因为其他地方（如美国）更忠实地践行了它们发现的原则。</p><p>[11] It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn’t the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.</p><p>[11] 这或许确实是一个充分条件。但如果是这样，工业革命为何没有更早发生？有两个可能的（且不矛盾的）答案：（a）它确实发生过 —— 工业革命是一系列变革中的一次。（b）因为在中世纪的城镇中，垄断和行会制度最初延缓了新生产方式的发展。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Write-Usefully"><a href="#How-to-Write-Usefully" class="headerlink" title="How to Write Usefully"></a>How to Write Usefully</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/useful.html">https://paulgraham.com/useful.html</a></p><p>February 2020</p><p>What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That’s what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.</p><p>一篇文章应该是什么样的？很多人会说 “有说服力”。这是我们很多人被教导的文章准则。但我认为，我们可以追求更宏大的目标：文章应当 “有用”。</p><p>To start with, that means it should be correct. But it’s not enough merely to be correct. It’s easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That’s a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can’t go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it’s a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.</p><p>首先，这意味着文章必须是正确的。但仅仅正确还不够。让一个表述正确很容易，只要让它足够模糊就行。比如，学术写作中就有这样一个常见缺陷：如果你对某个问题一无所知，说 “这个问题很复杂”“有很多因素需要考虑”“过于简化是错误的” 之类的话，就永远不会出错。</p><p>Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.</p><p>但这类表述即便正确，也无法告诉读者任何东西。有用的文章所提出的观点，要在不变成错误的前提下，尽可能有力。</p><p>For example, it’s more useful to say that Pike’s Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it’s in the exact middle of Colorado, I’ve now gone too far, because it’s a bit east of the middle.</p><p>举个例子，说 “派克峰在科罗拉多州中部附近”，比只说 “在科罗拉多州某处” 更有用。但如果我说 “它就在科罗拉多州正中心”，就过头了 —— 因为它其实在中心偏东一点。</p><p>Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It’s easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.</p><p>精确性和正确性就像一对相反的力。忽视其中一个，就很容易满足另一个。空洞的学术写作的对立面，是煽动者那种大胆却虚假的花言巧语。而有用的文章，既要大胆，又要真实。</p><p>It’s also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn’t already know.</p><p>此外，它还需要满足另外两个条件：告诉人们一些重要的事，且至少有一部分人此前并不知道。</p><p>Telling people something they didn’t know doesn’t always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.</p><p>告诉人们不知道的事，不一定意味着要让他们惊讶。有时，是把他们潜意识里知道、却从未用语言表达过的事说出来。事实上，这类见解可能更有价值，因为它们往往更根本。</p><p>Let’s put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn’t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.</p><p>把这些条件合起来：有用的文章，是用最明确的方式，告诉人们一些真实、重要且他们此前不知道的事。</p><p>Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can’t expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world’s 7 billion people. But it’s sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.</p><p>要注意，这些条件都有程度之分。比如，你不能指望一个观点对所有人来说都是新颖的。你的任何见解，全球 70 亿人中或许至少已有一人想到过。但只要对很多读者来说是新颖的，就足够了。</p><p>Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true.</p><p>正确性、重要性和明确性也是如此。实际上，这四个要素就像一组数字，相乘之后就能得出 “有用性” 的分数。我知道这几乎是生硬的简化，但事实的确如此。</p><hr><p>How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he’s sure it’s worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they’re usually right.</p><p>如何确保你所说的内容真实、新颖且重要？信不信由你，有个诀窍。我从朋友罗伯特・莫里斯那里学来的 —— 他极度害怕说蠢话。他的诀窍是：除非确定某句话值得听，否则绝不说。这让他很难发表看法，但一旦说出来，往往是对的。</p><p>Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don’t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.</p><p>放到文章写作中，这意味着：如果写出一句糟糕的话，就不要发表。删掉它，重新写。通常，你会放弃四五个段落的完整分支，有时甚至是整篇文章。</p><p>You can’t ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren’t.</p><p>你无法保证自己所有的想法都是好的，但可以保证发表的都是好的 —— 只要不发表那些不好的就行。</p><p>In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you’re exploring gets inconclusive results, you’re supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.</p><p>在科学界，这被称为 “发表偏倚”，被认为是不好的。当你探索的某个假设得出不确定的结果时，按理说也应该告诉人们。但写文章时，发表偏倚反而是可取的。</p><p>My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.</p><p>我的策略是 “先松后紧”：先快速写出文章初稿，尝试各种想法；然后花几天时间仔细修改。</p><p>I’ve never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I’m sure there are sentences I’ve read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they’re clumsily written, and sometimes because I’m not sure they’re true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I’m saying “Ugh, that part” each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won’t publish an essay till they’re all gone — till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.</p><p>我从没数过自己会校对文章多少次，但可以肯定，有些句子在发表前我读了不下 100 遍。校稿时，总会有一些段落显得刺眼 —— 有时是因为写得笨拙，有时是因为我不确定它是否正确。这种不适感一开始是潜意识的，但读了十遍左右后，每次读到那些地方，我都会想 “唉，这部分”。它们就像走过时会勾住袖子的荆棘。通常，我要等到这些 “荆棘” 都消失 —— 能一口气读完整篇文章，没有任何卡顿感 —— 才会发表。</p><p>I’ll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can’t think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn’t seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn’t seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn’t, and you’ve usually got the replacement right there in your head.</p><p>有时，如果想不出更好的表达方式，我会容忍一句略显笨拙的话，但绝不会明知某句话不正确还放过去。你永远不必这样做。如果一句话不对劲，只要问问自己为什么不对劲，脑子里通常就会出现替代方案。</p><p>This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don’t have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don’t have to publish the essay at all, if you can’t get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that’s what it feels like. What’s really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You’re like a parent saying to a child “we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables.” Except you’re the child too.</p><p>这是散文作家相对于记者的优势：你没有截稿日期。可以花足够多的时间把文章写对，写不对甚至可以不发表。错误在拥有无限时间的对手面前，似乎会失去勇气。至少感觉是这样。其实，是你对自己的期待不同了。就像父母对孩子说 “我们可以坐一整晚，直到你吃掉蔬菜”—— 只不过，你既是父母，也是孩子。</p><p>I’m not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in “A Way to Detect Bias” after readers pointed out that I’d omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.</p><p>我不是说不会有错误漏网。比如，在《一种检测偏见的方法》中，有读者指出我漏了（c）项，我后来补上了。但实际上，你几乎能抓住所有错误。</p><p>There’s a trick for getting importance too. It’s like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they’ll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.</p><p>获得 “重要性” 也有个诀窍，就像我给年轻创业者的建议：做自己想要的东西。你可以把自己当作读者的替身。读者和你不会完全不同，所以如果你写的话题对自己来说重要，对很多读者来说可能也重要。</p><p>Importance has two factors. It’s the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course that it’s not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum.</p><p>重要性有两个要素：受影响的人数，乘以这件事对他们的重要程度。这意味着它不是一个矩形，更像一把参差不齐的梳子，类似黎曼和。</p><p>The way to get novelty is to write about topics you’ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who’ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don’t learn anything from writing an essay, don’t publish it.</p><p>获得 “新颖性” 的方法，是写自己思考了很久的话题。这时，你也可以把自己当作读者的替身。如果你 —— 一个思考过这个话题很久的人 —— 发现某件事很惊讶，那么很多读者可能也会惊讶。而且，和正确性、重要性一样，你可以用莫里斯的诀窍来确保这一点：如果写一篇文章时没学到新东西，就不要发表。</p><p>You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you’re an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn’t know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn’t know it either.</p><p>衡量新颖性需要谦逊，因为承认一个想法的新颖性，意味着承认自己此前不知道它。自信和谦逊通常被视为对立面，但在这件事上（以及很多其他事上），自信能帮你保持谦逊。如果你知道自己是某个领域的专家，就可以坦然承认学到了新知识 —— 因为你有信心，大多数人也不知道。</p><p>The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you’re sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm’s length with perhapses.</p><p>有用的文章的第四个要素 “明确性”，来自两点：清晰的思考，以及对限定语的巧妙使用。这两者相互平衡，就像手动挡汽车的油门和离合器。当你试图完善一个想法的表达时，会相应地调整限定语。对于确定的事，你可以直言不讳，不加任何限定 —— 就像我表述有用写作的四个要素时那样。而那些存疑的观点，可能需要用 “或许” 之类的词保持距离。</p><p>As you refine an idea, you’re pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don’t even want to, if it’s a side point and a fully refined version would be too long.</p><p>完善想法时，你会朝着减少限定的方向努力，但很少能减到零。有时甚至不想减到零 —— 如果那是个次要观点，完全完善的版本可能太长了。</p><p>Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with “I think,” because if you’re saying it, then of course you think it. And it’s true that “I think x” is a weaker statement than simply “x.” Which is exactly why you need “I think.” You need it to express your degree of certainty.</p><p>有人说限定语会削弱文章的力量。比如，文章里不该用 “我认为” 开头，因为你说出来的话，显然是你认为的。的确，“我认为 x” 比单纯说 “x” 要弱。但这正是需要 “我认为” 的原因：它能表达你的确定程度。</p><p>But qualifications are not scalars. They’re not just experimental error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it’s so, even how it could be falsified. I’m not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. It’s probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I’ll just give you a practical tip: Don’t underestimate qualification. It’s an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it’s part of having them.</p><p>但限定语不是标量，不只是 “实验误差”。它们能表达的东西恐怕有 50 种：适用范围有多广、你是如何得知的、你对此有多认同、甚至它如何能被证伪。我不想在这里探讨限定语的结构 —— 它可能比 “如何写出有用的文章” 这个话题本身更复杂。我只想给个实用建议：不要低估限定语。它本身就是一项重要技能，不只是为了避免说错话而必须交的 “税”。所以，要学习并充分运用它的全部功能。它或许不算 “提出好想法” 的一半，但也是其中一部分。</p><p>There’s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don’t think this is a component of usefulness. It’s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it’s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I’ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader’s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that’s too long.</p><p>我写文章时还追求一点：尽可能简单地表达。但我不认为这是 “有用性” 的要素，更多是对读者的体谅。而且，它能帮你把事情做对 —— 用简单的语言表达时，错误更明显。但说实话，我写得简单，主要不是为了读者，也不是为了更容易写对，而是因为用多余或花哨的词会让我不舒服。这显得不雅，就像一段太长的程序。</p><p>I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you’re sure you’re one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can.</p><p>我知道华丽的文字对有些人有用。但除非你确定自己是那类人，否则最好的建议是：尽可能写得简单。</p><hr><p>I believe the formula I’ve given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should warn you that it’s also a recipe for making people mad.</p><p>我认为，“重要性 + 新颖性 + 正确性 + 明确性” 这个公式，就是写出好文章的秘诀。但我得提醒你，这也可能让人生气。</p><p>The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn’t know, they don’t always thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don’t know something is because they don’t want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you’re looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.</p><p>问题的根源在于 “新颖性”。当你告诉人们他们不知道的事时，他们未必会感谢你。有时，人们不知道某件事，是因为他们不想知道 —— 通常是因为这件事和他们珍视的信念相矛盾。事实上，如果你想找新颖的想法，流行却错误的信念是个好地方。每个流行的错误信念，都会围绕它形成一个 “思想死区”—— 因为与它矛盾，这些想法相对未被探索。</p><p>The strength component just makes things worse. If there’s anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it’s having them flatly contradicted.</p><p>“明确性” 会让情况更糟。如果说有什么比 “珍视的假设被反驳” 更让人恼火，那就是 “被直言不讳地反驳”。</p><p>Plus if you’ve used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you’ll seem confident is that you are confident: you’ve cheated, by only publishing the things you’re sure of. It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you’re wrong. In fact you constantly admit you’re wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.</p><p>再加上如果你用了莫里斯的诀窍，你的文章会显得很自信。对不同意你的人来说，这种自信可能很刺耳。你显得自信，是因为你确实自信：你 “作弊” 了 —— 只发表自己确定的内容。那些想反驳你的人会觉得，你从不承认自己错了。但实际上，你一直在承认错误 —— 只是在发表前，而不是之后。</p><p>And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you’ll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.</p><p>如果你写得尽可能简单，只会让情况更糟。简洁是命令的口吻。你会发现，地位较低的人传递坏消息时，往往会说很多话来缓和冲击。而对人说话简短，差不多就是粗鲁。</p><p>It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean. To put “perhaps” in front of something you’re actually quite sure of. But you’ll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.</p><p>有时，故意把话说得比实际想法弱一点是有用的。比如，在你很确定的事前面加个 “或许”。但你会发现，作家这么做时，通常会带点暗示。</p><p>I don’t like to do this too much. It’s cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.</p><p>我不太喜欢这么做。整篇文章都用讽刺的语气，会显得俗气。我想，我们得接受一个事实：优雅和简略其实是一回事。</p><p>You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That’s sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice that’s little consolation.</p><p>你可能觉得，只要足够努力确保文章正确，它就不会被攻击。某种程度上是对的 —— 它不会被合理地攻击。但实际上，这没什么安慰作用。</p><p>In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you’ve stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false.</p><p>事实上，有用的文章的 “明确性” 会让你特别容易被曲解。如果你把一个想法表达得尽可能有力又不虚假，那么任何人只要稍微夸大一点你说的话，它就变成错误的了。</p><p>Much of the time they’re not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you’ll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you’ve actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.</p><p>很多时候，他们并非故意。如果你开始写文章，会发现一个很惊讶的事：不同意你的人，很少反驳你实际写的内容。他们会编造你 “说过” 的话，然后反驳那个。</p><p>For what it’s worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say “for what it’s worth” because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.</p><p>不妨试试这个对策：让曲解你的人引用你写的某句话或某段话，解释为什么它是错的。我说 “不妨试试”，是因为他们从没这么做过。所以，虽然这看似能让混乱的讨论回到正轨，但事实是，讨论从一开始就不在正轨上。</p><p>Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they’re misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact it’s sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered.</p><p>是否应该明确预防可能的误解？是的，如果那是一个聪明且善意的人可能产生的误解。事实上，有时先说一句略带误导的话，再补充纠正，比试图一次说对更有效 —— 这能模拟发现某个想法的过程。</p><p>But I don’t think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don’t want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don’t think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don’t want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn’t. I suspect it’s the same skill.</p><p>但我认为，不应该在文章主体中明确预防故意的误解。文章是与真诚的读者相遇的地方。为了防备不真诚的人而给窗户装铁栏，会毁掉你的 “房子”。防备故意误解的地方应该是尾注。但别指望能预测所有误解。当你说的话是他们不想听的，人们曲解你的本事，和他们为想做却知道不该做的事找借口的本事一样大。我怀疑这是同一种技能。</p><hr><p>As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we’ve examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write.</p><p>和大多数事情一样，写文章的技巧也需要练习。但该如何开始？既然我们已经分析了有用的写作的结构，就能更精确地重述这个问题：一开始应该放宽哪个约束？答案是 “重要性” 的第一个要素：关心你所写内容的人数。</p><p>If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you’re an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that’s fine. You’re helping them, and you’re writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about.</p><p>如果你把话题缩得足够小，或许能找到自己擅长的领域。先写这个。即使只有 10 个关心的读者，也没关系。你在帮他们，也在练习写作。之后，再扩大写作的话题范围。</p><p>The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn’t have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along I’d had a lot of practice.</p><p>另一个可以放宽的约束有点出人意料：发表。写文章不一定意味着要发表。现在大家都倾向于把随便一个想法都发出来，这显得奇怪，但对我有用。我在笔记本上写了差不多 15 年类似文章的东西，从没发表过，也没想过要发表。我写它们是为了理清思路。但当网络出现时，我已经有了很多练习。</p><p>Incidentally, Steve Wozniak did the same thing. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn’t build them because he couldn’t afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready.</p><p>顺便说一句，史蒂夫・沃兹尼亚克也是如此。高中时，他为了好玩，在纸上设计电脑。他造不出来，因为买不起零件。但 1975 年英特尔推出 4K DRAM 时，他已经准备好了。</p><hr><p>How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I’ve learned about essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.</p><p>但还有多少文章有待写作？这个问题的答案，可能是我在文章写作中最令人兴奋的发现：几乎所有文章都还没写。</p><p>Although the essay is an old form, it hasn’t been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn’t enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.</p><p>尽管散文是一种古老的体裁，但并未被精心培育。在印刷时代，出版成本高，对散文的需求也不足以支撑大量出版。你得先因写小说之类的东西出名，才能发表散文；或者写书评，借机表达自己的想法。但没有成为散文作家的直接路径。这意味着很少有散文被写出，而写出的那些，主题范围也很窄。</p><p>Now, thanks to the internet, there’s a path. Anyone can publish essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start. You don’t need anyone’s permission.</p><p>现在，多亏了互联网，有了路径。任何人都能在网上发表散文。或许一开始默默无闻，但至少能开始，不需要任何人的许可。</p><p>It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.</p><p>有时，某个知识领域会沉寂多年，直到某个变化让它爆发。密码学让数论爆发，互联网正在让散文爆发。</p><p>The exciting thing is not that there’s a lot left to write, but that there’s a lot left to discover. There’s a certain kind of idea that’s best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.</p><p>令人兴奋的不是还有很多文章要写，而是还有很多发现要做。有一种想法，最适合通过写散文来发现。如果大多数散文还没写，那么大多数这类想法也还没被发现。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don’t put bars on the windows.</p><p>[1] 给阳台装护栏，但别给窗户装铁栏。</p><p>[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for publication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should do, and they were really helpful.</p><p>[2] 即便现在，我有时也会写一些不打算发表的文章。我曾写过几篇，目的是理清 Y Combinator（一家创业孵化器）应该做什么，这些文章真的很有帮助。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Before-the-Startup"><a href="#Before-the-Startup" class="headerlink" title="Before the Startup"></a>Before the Startup</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/before.html">https://paulgraham.com/before.html</a></p><p>October 2014</p><p>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman’s startup class at Stanford. It’s intended for college students, but much of it is applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</p><p>（本文改编自我在斯坦福大学山姆・奥特曼创业课上的客座演讲。内容虽面向大学生，但其中很多观点也适用于其他年龄段的潜在创业者。）</p><p>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give advice, you can ask yourself “what would I tell my own kids?” My kids are little, but I can imagine what I’d tell them about startups if they were in college, and that’s what I’m going to tell you.</p><p>有孩子的好处之一是，当你需要给出建议时，你可以问自己：“我会对自己的孩子说什么？” 我的孩子还小，但我能想象如果他们上了大学，我会跟他们讲哪些关于创业的事 —— 接下来我要讲的就是这些。</p><p>Startups are very counterintuitive. I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s just because knowledge about them hasn’t permeated our culture yet. But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can’t always trust your instincts.</p><p>创业这件事非常反直觉。我不确定原因何在，或许是因为关于创业的知识还没渗透到我们的文化中。但无论如何，创业时，你不能总相信自己的直觉。</p><p>It’s like skiing in that way. When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back. But if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control. So part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. Eventually you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort. At first there’s a list of things you’re trying to remember as you start down the hill.</p><p>这有点像滑雪。第一次滑雪时，你想减速，直觉会让你向后仰。但滑雪时向后仰，你只会失控地冲下山坡。所以学滑雪的一部分内容，就是学会抑制这种冲动。最终你会养成新习惯，但一开始必须有意识地努力 —— 刚开始下坡时，你得时刻记着一长串注意事项。</p><p>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there’s a similar list for startups. Here I’m going to give you the first part of it — the things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.</p><p>创业和滑雪一样 “违背天性”，所以也有这么一串注意事项。接下来我要说的是第一部分 —— 如果你想为创业做准备，需要记住这些事。</p><p><strong>Counterintuitive</strong></p><p><strong>反直觉</strong></p><p>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you’ll make a lot of mistakes. If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.</p><p>第一条就是我已经提到的：创业太特殊了，如果你相信直觉，会犯很多错。哪怕你只知道这一点，至少在犯错前会犹豫一下。</p><p>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore. It’s really true. Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes they’re about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come back a year later and say “I wish we’d listened.”</p><p>我运营 Y Combinator 时，常开玩笑说我们的作用就是告诉创始人一些他们会无视的事。这话千真万确。一批又一批创业者，YC 的合伙人会警告他们即将犯下的错误，他们不听，一年后回来却说：“真该听你们的。”</p><p>Why do the founders ignore the partners’ advice? Well, that’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions. They seem wrong. So of course your first impulse is to disregard them. And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse of Y Combinator but part of its raison d’etre. If founders’ instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn’t need us. You only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That’s why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors. [1]</p><p>为什么创始人会无视合伙人的建议？这就是反直觉观点的特点：它们和你的直觉相悖，看起来是错的。所以你第一反应肯定是无视。其实我那句玩笑不只是 YC 的 “魔咒”，更是它存在的意义。如果创始人的直觉本身就能给出正确答案，他们就不需要我们了。你只需要那些能给你带来意外启发的建议。这也是滑雪教练很多，而跑步教练很少的原因。[1]</p><p>You can, however, trust your instincts about people. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say “I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.”</p><p>不过，你可以相信自己对人的直觉。事实上，年轻创业者最常犯的错误之一，就是不够相信这种直觉。他们会和那些看起来很厉害，但自己私下里有点疑虑的人合作。后来出问题时，他们会说：“我早觉得他有点不对劲，但他看起来太厉害了，我就没在意。”</p><p>If you’re thinking about getting involved with someone — as a cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you have misgivings about them, trust your gut. If someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don’t ignore it.</p><p>如果你考虑和某人合作 —— 无论是作为联合创始人、员工、投资者还是收购方 —— 并且对他们有疑虑，相信你的直觉。如果某人看起来油滑、虚伪或混蛋，别无视这种感觉。</p><p>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with people you genuinely like, and you’ve known long enough to be sure.</p><p>这种情况下，“任性” 一点是值得的。和你真心喜欢、且认识足够久能信任的人一起工作。</p><p><strong>Expertise</strong></p><p><strong>专业知识</strong></p><p>The second counterintuitive point is that it’s not that important to know a lot about startups. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you’re solving for them. Mark Zuckerberg didn’t succeed because he was an expert on startups. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he understood his users really well.</p><p>第二个反直觉的点是：懂多少创业知识没那么重要。在创业中成功的关键，不是成为创业专家，而是成为用户和你要解决的问题的专家。马克・扎克伯格能成功，不是因为他是创业专家。他完全是创业新手，却能成功，因为他太了解自己的用户了。</p><p>If you don’t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don’t feel bad on that account. That sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you’ve done it.</p><p>比如，如果你根本不知道怎么进行天使轮融资，别为此懊恼。这类事需要时能学会，做完后也能忘掉。</p><p>In fact, I worry it’s not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn’t think “here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.” It would set off alarms. Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that’s actually essential: making something people want.</p><p>其实我担心的是，深入学习创业机制不仅没必要，甚至可能有点危险。如果我遇到一个本科生，他对可转换票据、员工协议，甚至（老天保佑）FF 级股票了如指掌，我不会觉得 “这人比同龄人领先太多”，反而会警觉。因为年轻创业者还有一个典型错误：走创业的 “流程”。他们编一个听起来合理的想法，以不错的估值融到钱，租个酷炫的办公室，雇一群人。从表面看，这就是创业该做的事。但租完办公室、雇好人之后，下一步就是：逐渐意识到自己彻底完蛋了 —— 因为他们模仿了创业的所有外在形式，却忽略了唯一真正重要的事：做出人们需要的东西。</p><p><strong>Game</strong></p><p><strong>游戏思维</strong></p><p>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that’s what they’ve been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point. Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Extracurricular activities, check. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.</p><p>这种事我们见得太多，以至于给它起了个名字：“过家家”。后来我才明白为什么会这样。年轻创业者走创业流程，是因为这是他们迄今为止的人生中被训练做的事。比如，想想你为了上大学要做什么：课外活动，打勾。甚至大学课程里的大部分作业，都像绕圈跑步一样虚假。</p><p>I’m not attacking the educational system for being this way. There will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when you’re being taught something, and if you measure their performance it’s inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point where much of what you’re measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.</p><p>我不是在攻击教育体系。当你在学习时，做的事总会有一定虚假性；而当你要衡量表现时，人们不可避免地会利用这种虚假性，以至于你衡量的很多东西，其实都是虚假的产物。</p><p>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape to make good exam questions. The way I studied for exams in these classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the main thing I’d be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions would turn up on the exam. It was like a game.</p><p>坦白说，我在大学时也这么干过。我发现很多课程里，可能只有二三十个概念适合出成考题。我备考的方式不是（至少不只是）掌握课程内容，而是列出可能的考题，提前想好答案。走进期末考试考场时，我最想知道的是自己押的题能中多少。这就像一场游戏。</p><p>It’s not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders’ first impulse on starting a startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the tricks are for convincing investors. We tell them the best way to convince investors is to make a startup that’s actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so. Then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast. And we have to tell them the best way to do that is simply to make something people want.</p><p>所以，当年轻创业者被训练了一辈子玩这种 “游戏” 后，他们创业的第一反应就是想找出赢得这场新 “游戏” 的诀窍，这并不奇怪。因为融资似乎成了衡量创业成功的标准（另一个典型的新手错误），他们总想问说服投资者的诀窍。我们告诉他们，说服投资者的最好方式，是让创业公司真的做得好 —— 也就是快速增长，然后如实告诉投资者。接着他们又想知道快速增长的诀窍。我们只能告诉他们，最好的方式就是做出人们需要的东西。</p><p>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders begin with the founder asking “How do we…” and the partner replying “Just…”</p><p>YC 合伙人与年轻创业者的很多对话，都是从创业者问 “我们该怎么……” 开始，合伙人回答 “只要……” 结束。</p><p>Why do the founders always make things so complicated? The reason, I realized, is that they’re looking for the trick.</p><p>为什么创业者总把事情搞得这么复杂？我意识到，因为他们在找 “诀窍”。</p><p>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. [2] But that doesn’t work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.</p><p>所以创业的第三个反直觉之处是：创业是 “钻空子” 思维失效的地方。如果你去大公司工作，“钻空子” 可能还管用。取决于公司有多混乱，你可以靠拍对马屁、装出高效的样子等方式成功。[2] 但这在创业中没用。没有老板可以糊弄，只有用户，而用户只关心你的产品是否满足他们的需求。创业像物理一样客观：你必须做出人们需要的东西，且只有在做到这一点时才能发展。</p><p>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you’re super good at sounding like you know what you’re talking about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two rounds of funding. But it’s not in your interest to. The company is ultimately doomed. All you’re doing is wasting your own time riding it down.</p><p>危险的是，“装样子” 在投资者那里多少有点用。如果你特别擅长装得很懂行，至少能骗到一轮融资，甚至两轮。但这对你没好处。公司最终注定失败，你只是在浪费自己的时间陪它走向终结。</p><p>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing about fundraising but has made something users love will have an easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder who has made something users love is the one who will go on to succeed after raising the money.</p><p>所以别再找诀窍了。创业中确实有诀窍，任何领域都有，但它们的重要性比解决实际问题低一个数量级。一个不懂融资，但做出了用户喜爱的产品的创始人，比一个精通所有融资技巧，但用户增长停滞的创始人更容易融到钱。更重要的是，做出用户喜爱的产品的创始人，融资后才能继续成功。</p><p>Though in a sense it’s bad news in that you’re deprived of one of your most powerful weapons, I think it’s exciting that gaming the system stops working when you start a startup. It’s exciting that there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good work. Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do. [3] I would have been delighted if I’d realized in college that there were parts of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others, and a few where it hardly mattered at all. But there are, and this variation is one of the most important things to consider when you’re thinking about your future. How do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4]</p><p>虽然从某种角度说，不能再用 “钻空子” 这种强大武器有点遗憾，但我觉得创业中 “钻空子” 失效这件事很令人兴奋。世界上居然有这样的领域，你靠做好工作就能成功，这太让人激动了。想象一下，如果世界全像学校和大公司那样 —— 你要么花大量时间做无用功，要么输给那些做无用功的人 —— 那该多令人沮丧。[3] 如果我在大学时就意识到，现实世界中有些领域 “钻空子” 没那么重要，甚至几乎不重要，我会很高兴。但这样的领域确实存在，而在思考未来时，这种差异是你需要考虑的最重要的事之一：在每种工作中，你要靠什么成功？你希望靠什么成功？[4]</p><p><strong>All-Consuming</strong></p><p><strong>全身心投入</strong></p><p>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here.</p><p>这就引出了第四个反直觉的点：创业会占据你的全部生活。如果你创业，它对你生活的占据程度会超出你的想象。如果创业成功，它会占据你的生活很长时间：至少好几年，可能十年，甚至整个职业生涯。所以这里有实实在在的机会成本。</p><p>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable. Basically at 25 he started running as fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn’t stopped to catch his breath since. Every day new shit happens in the Google empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal with it. If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week’s backlog of shit accumulates. And he has to bear this uncomplainingly, partly because as the company’s daddy he can never show fear or weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy if they talk about having difficult lives. Which has the strange side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder is concealed from almost everyone except those who’ve done it.</p><p>拉里・佩奇的生活似乎很令人羡慕，但也有不那么令人羡慕的地方。基本上，他 25 岁时就开始拼命奔跑，而且从那以后似乎就没停下来喘过气。谷歌帝国每天都有新麻烦，只有 CEO 能处理，而他作为 CEO，必须去处理。哪怕休假一周，就会堆积一周的麻烦。他还得毫无怨言地承受这一切，部分原因是作为公司的 “大家长”，他不能表现出恐惧或软弱；另一部分原因是，亿万富翁抱怨生活艰难，只会得到零甚至负的同情。这就产生了一个奇怪的副作用：成功创业者的艰难，几乎只有亲身经历过的人才知道。</p><p>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same thing. It never gets any easier. The nature of the problems change. You’re worrying about construction delays at your London office instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment. But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases.</p><p>YC 投资过几家能称为 “巨大成功” 的公司，每一家的创始人都说过同样的话：创业从来不会变轻松。问题的性质会变 —— 你担心的可能是伦敦办公室的建设延期，而不是工作室公寓里坏掉的空调 —— 但担忧的总量从未减少，甚至可能增加。</p><p>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that it’s like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably. And while it’s truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of things that are easier to do before you have them than after. Many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in rich countries do.</p><p>成功创业有点像生孩子：按下按钮，你的生活就会发生不可逆转的改变。虽然生孩子真的很美好，但很多事在生孩子前做比生完后更容易，其中很多事还能让你成为更好的父母。而因为可以推迟 “按下按钮”，富裕国家的大多数人都会这么做。</p><p>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they’re supposed to start them while they’re still in college. Are you crazy? And what are the universities thinking? They go out of their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives, and yet they’re setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.</p><p>但说到创业，很多人似乎觉得应该在大学时就开始。你疯了吗？大学在想什么？他们费尽心思确保学生能拿到避孕药，却又到处搞创业项目和创业孵化器。</p><p>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming students are interested in startups. Universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers. So students who want to start startups hope universities can teach them about startups. And whether universities can do this or not, there’s some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants to other universities that do.</p><p>公平地说，大学也是迫不得已。很多新生对创业感兴趣，而大学至少在事实上被期望为学生的职业生涯做准备。所以想创业的学生希望大学能教他们创业知识。不管大学能不能做到，都有压力让它们宣称自己能做到，否则就会有学生流向那些宣称能教创业的大学。</p><p>Can universities teach students about startups? Yes and no. They can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this is not what you need to know. What you need to learn about are the needs of your own users, and you can’t do that until you actually start the company. [5] So starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it. And it’s impossible to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups take over your life. You can’t start a startup for real as a student, because if you start a startup for real you’re not a student anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won’t even be that for long. [6]</p><p>大学能教学生创业吗？能，也不能。它们能教关于创业的知识，但如我之前所说，这不是你需要知道的。你需要了解的是自己用户的需求，而这只有在你真正开了公司后才能做到。[5] 所以创业本质上是只能在实践中学习的事。而在大学里不可能真正创业，原因我刚才说了：创业会占据你的全部生活。作为学生，你不可能真正创业，因为一旦认真创业，你就不再是学生了。可能名义上还是学生一段时间，但也长不了。[6]</p><p>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take? Be a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and not be a student? I can answer that one for you. Do not start a startup in college. How to start a startup is just a subset of a bigger problem you’re trying to solve: how to have a good life. And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it. Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search. Most people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.</p><p>面对这种二分法，你该选哪条路？做真正的学生，不创业？还是真正创业，不当学生？我可以告诉你答案：别在大学时创业。“如何创业” 只是你要解决的更大问题的一个子集：如何拥有美好的人生。虽然对很多有野心的人来说，创业可以是美好人生的一部分，但 20 岁不是最佳时机。创业就像一场极其快速的深度优先搜索，而大多数人在 20 岁时，仍应该进行广度优先搜索。</p><p>You can do things in your early 20s that you can’t do as well before or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline. For unambitious people, this sort of thing is the dreaded “failure to launch,” but for the ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration. If you start a startup at 20 and you’re sufficiently successful, you’ll never get to do it. [7]</p><p>二十出头时，你能做一些之前和之后都做不好的事：凭一时兴起深入投入某个项目，或者毫无时间压力地超低价旅行。对没野心的人来说，这种事是可怕的 “停滞不前”，但对有野心的人来说，这可能是无比宝贵的探索。如果你 20 岁创业且足够成功，就再也没机会做这些事了。[7]</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country. He can do other things most people can’t, like charter jets to fly him to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he’s running Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a project you consider your life’s work, there are advantages to serendipity too, especially early in life. Among other things it gives you more options to choose your life’s work from.</p><p>马克・扎克伯格永远不会有在异国他乡闲逛的经历了。他能做很多人做不到的事，比如包机去国外，但成功夺走了他生活中很多偶然性。 Facebook 在运营他，就像他在运营 Facebook 一样。虽然被一个你视为毕生事业的项目 “掌控” 可能很酷，但偶然性也有其优势，尤其是在人生早期。比如，它能给你更多选择，让你从中挑选毕生事业。</p><p>There’s not even a tradeoff here. You’re not sacrificing anything if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you’re more likely to succeed if you wait. In the unlikely case that you’re 20 and one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you’ll face a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run with it. But the usual way startups take off is for the founders to make them take off, and it’s gratuitously stupid to do that at 20.</p><p>这甚至算不上权衡。20 岁时放弃创业，你不会损失什么，因为等一等，你成功的可能性更高。万一你 20 岁时，某个副业像 Facebook 那样爆发，你会面临选择：要不要全力以赴。这种情况下，全力以赴可能是合理的。但创业通常需要创始人推动才能发展，而 20 岁就这么做，实在是没必要的愚蠢。</p><p><strong>Try</strong></p><p><strong>尝试</strong></p><p>Should you do it at any age? I realize I’ve made startups sound pretty hard. If I haven’t, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard. What if it’s too hard? How can you tell if you’re up to this challenge?</p><p>那任何年龄都该创业吗？我意识到自己把创业说得挺难的。如果还没说清楚，我再强调一次：创业真的很难。如果太难了呢？你怎么知道自己能否应对这个挑战？</p><p>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can’t tell. Your life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football player. But unless you’ve had a very strange life you haven’t done much that was like being a startup founder. Starting a startup will change you a lot. So what you’re trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?</p><p>答案是第五个反直觉的点：你不知道。到目前为止的人生，可能让你大致知道自己成为数学家或职业足球运动员的前景如何。但除非你的人生非常奇特，否则你没做过多少和创业类似的事。创业会极大地改变你。所以你要评估的不仅是现在的自己，还有未来可能成长为的样子 —— 谁能做到这一点呢？</p><p>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would have what it took to start successful startups. It was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold. The hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become. There may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that, so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the answer is: not much. I learned to keep a completely open mind about which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.</p><p>过去 9 年，我的工作就是预测人们是否有能力创办成功的公司。判断他们有多聪明很容易，读这篇文章的大多数人都超过了这个门槛。难的是预测他们会变得多坚韧、多有野心。可能没人比我更有经验做这种预测了，所以我可以告诉你，专家能知道多少 —— 答案是：不多。我学会了对每批创业公司中哪些会成为明星保持完全开放的心态。</p><p>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure they will ace Y Combinator just as they’ve aced every one of the (few, artificial, easy) tests they’ve faced in life so far. Others arrive wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn’t discover whatever mistake caused it to accept them. But there is little correlation between founders’ initial attitudes and how well their companies do.</p><p>创始人自己有时觉得知道答案。有些人来的时候，确信自己能在 YC 表现出色，就像他们在人生中遇到的所有（少数、虚假、简单的）测试中表现出色一样。另一些人来的时候，疑惑自己怎么会被选中，担心 YC 会发现接受他们是个错误。但创始人最初的态度和公司最终的表现几乎没什么关联。</p><p>I’ve read that the same is true in the military — that the swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous lives.</p><p>我读过一些关于军队的内容 —— 那些昂首阔步的新兵，并不比安静的新兵更可能成为真正坚韧的人。原因可能相同：军队的考验和他们之前经历的完全不同。</p><p>If you’re absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn’t do it. But if you’re merely unsure whether you’re up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.</p><p>如果你对创业极度恐惧，可能确实不该做。但如果你只是不确定自己能否应对，唯一的办法就是尝试。只是现在别试。</p><p><strong>Ideas</strong></p><p><strong>想法</strong></p><p>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in college? There are only two things you need initially: an idea and cofounders. And the m.o. for getting both is the same. Which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.</p><p>所以如果你某天想创业，大学时该做什么？最初只需要两样东西：一个想法和联合创始人。而获得这两样东西的方法是一样的。这就引出了第六个，也是最后一个反直觉的点：获取创业想法的方式，不是刻意去想创业想法。</p><p>I’ve written a whole essay on this, so I won’t repeat it all here. But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding, meaning you’ll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they’re bad.</p><p>我专门写过一篇文章讲这个，这里就不重复了。但简而言之，如果你刻意去想创业想法，想出来的不仅会很糟，还会糟得听起来很合理 —— 这意味着你会在意识到它们很糟之前，浪费大量时间。</p><p>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don’t even realize at first that they’re startup ideas.</p><p>想出好的创业想法的方法是退一步。不要刻意去想，而是把自己的大脑变成那种能无意识产生创业想法的类型。事实上，无意识到你一开始甚至没意识到它们是创业想法。</p><p>This is not only possible, it’s how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all got started. None of these companies were even meant to be companies at first. They were all just side projects. The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.</p><p>这不仅可能，苹果、雅虎、谷歌和 Facebook 都是这么来的。这些公司最初都没打算成为公司，只是副业。最好的创业公司几乎都得从副业开始，因为好想法往往太非主流，你的意识会拒绝把它们当成创业想法。</p><p>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.</p><p>那么，如何把自己的大脑变成能无意识产生创业想法的类型？（1）大量学习重要的东西；（2）解决你感兴趣的问题；（3）和你喜欢且尊重的人一起。顺便说一句，第三点也是同时找到联合创始人的方法。</p><p>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of “learn a lot about things that matter,” I wrote “become good at some technology.” But that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow. What was special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were experts in technology. They were good at design, and perhaps even more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making projects happen. So you don’t have to work on technology per se, so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.</p><p>我第一次写这段话时，把 “大量学习重要的东西” 写成了 “精通某项技术”。但这个说法虽然充分，却太狭隘了。布莱恩・切斯基和乔・格比亚的特别之处，不是他们精通技术，而是他们擅长设计，或许更重要的是，他们擅长组织团队、推动项目落地。所以你不一定非要做技术相关的事，只要你解决的问题足够有挑战性，能让你成长就行。</p><p>What kind of problems are those? That is very hard to answer in the general case. History is full of examples of young people who were working on important problems that no one else at the time thought were important, and in particular that their parents didn’t think were important. On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their kids were wasting their time and who were right. So how do you know when you’re working on real stuff? [8]</p><p>哪些问题是这样的？总体来说很难回答。历史上满是这样的例子：年轻人在做一些当时没人觉得重要的事，尤其是他们的父母不觉得重要的事。但另一方面，历史上更多的例子是：父母觉得孩子在浪费时间，结果确实如此。那你怎么知道自己在做的是 “正经事”？[8]</p><p>I know how I know. Real problems are interesting, and I am self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make myself work on boring things, even if they’re supposed to be important.</p><p>我知道自己怎么判断。真正的问题是有趣的，而我有点 “任性”—— 我总想做有趣的事，哪怕没人在乎（事实上，尤其是没人在乎的时候），而让我做无聊的事，哪怕别人说很重要，我也很难做到。</p><p>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful in some worldly way. Y Combinator itself was something I only did because it seemed interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that helps me out. But I don’t know what other people have in their heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup. And indeed, probably also the best way to live. [9]</p><p>我的人生中有很多例子：我因为觉得某事有趣而去做，后来发现它在现实中很有用。YC 本身就是我因为觉得有趣才做的。所以我似乎有个内在的指南针帮我。但我不知道别人的脑子里有什么。或许再想想，我能总结出一些识别真正有趣的问题的方法，但目前我能给的最好建议，虽然有点循环论证，就是：如果你对真正有趣的问题有感觉，那么积极地追随这种感觉，就是为创业做准备的最好方式。事实上，这可能也是最好的生活方式。[9]</p><p>But although I can’t explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them. If you think of technology as something that’s spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to “live in the future.” When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they’re startup ideas, but you’ll know they’re something that ought to exist.</p><p>虽然我没法笼统地解释什么是有趣的问题，但我可以告诉你一大部分这类问题。如果你把技术看作一种像分形污渍一样蔓延的东西，那么边缘上每一个移动的点都代表一个有趣的问题。所以，让自己的大脑产生好的创业想法的一个可靠方法，是让自己站在某项技术的前沿 —— 用保罗・布赫海特的话说，就是 “活在未来”。当你达到那个境界，那些在别人看来不可思议的前瞻性想法，对你来说会很明显。你可能没意识到它们是创业想法，但你会知道它们应该存在。</p><p>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software. He didn’t mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this is exactly the way the best startups get started.</p><p>比如，90 年代中期，我在哈佛的朋友罗伯特和特雷弗有个同学，自己写了 IP 语音软件。他没打算用它创业，也从没尝试把它变成公司。他只是想和在台湾的女朋友通话，又不想付长途话费，而作为网络专家，对他来说，把声音转换成数据包通过互联网发送，是很自然的做法。他的软件只用来和女朋友通话，没做其他事，但这正是最好的创业公司开始的方式。</p><p>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational version of college focused on “entrepreneurship.” It’s the classic version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to start a startup after college, what you should do in college is learn powerful things. And if you have genuine intellectual curiosity, that’s what you’ll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations. [10]</p><p>所以奇怪的是，如果你想成为成功的创业者，大学时最该做的，不是那种专注于 “创业” 的新型职业教育，而是经典的、为教育而教育的大学模式。如果你想毕业后创业，大学时该做的是学习有力量的知识。如果你有真正的求知欲，追随自己的兴趣，自然就会这么做。[10]</p><p>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.</p><p>创业中真正重要的是领域专长。成为拉里・佩奇的方法，是成为搜索领域的专家；而成为搜索领域专家的方法，是被真正的好奇心驱动，而非别有用心。</p><p>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you’ll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.</p><p>最好的情况是，创业只是好奇心的 “副产品”。而如果你把这个 “副产品” 的念头放在过程的末尾，会做得最好。</p><p>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders, boiled down to two words: just learn.</p><p>所以，给年轻的潜在创业者的最终建议，浓缩成两个词：学习就好。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a predictor of success. One of the things I remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.</p><p>[1] 有些创始人更愿意倾听，这往往是成功的预兆。我记得 Airbnb 的创始人在 YC 期间，听得非常认真。</p><p>[2] In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible. If big companies weren’t plagued by internal inefficiencies, they’d be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.</p><p>[2] 事实上，这也是创业有可能存在的原因之一。如果大公司没有内部低效，它们的效率会成比例地更高，留给创业公司的空间就会更少。</p><p>[3] In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on schleps, but this sort of work is merely unglamorous, not bogus.</p><p>[3] 创业中你确实要花很多时间做琐碎的事，但这种工作只是不风光，并非无用。</p><p>[4] What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system? Management consulting.</p><p>[4] 如果你真正的志向是 “钻空子”，那就去做管理咨询吧。</p><p>[5] The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get significant numbers of users, you’ve started it, whether you realize it yet or not.</p><p>[5] 公司可能还没注册，但如果你开始有大量用户，不管你有没有意识到，你已经创业了。</p><p>[6] It shouldn’t be that surprising that colleges can’t teach students how to be good startup founders, because they can’t teach them how to be good employees either.</p><p>The way universities “teach” students how to be employees is to hand off the task to companies via internship programs. But you couldn’t do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition if the students did well they would never come back.</p><p>[6] 大学教不会学生如何成为优秀的创业者，这并不奇怪，因为它们也教不会学生如何成为优秀的员工。大学 “教” 学生如何成为员工的方式，是通过实习项目把这个任务交给公司。但对创业来说，没法这么做 —— 因为按理说，如果学生做得好，就再也不会回来了。</p><p>[7] Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. It was only because he was otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he could accept it. And yet if he hadn’t we probably would not know his name.</p><p>[7] 查尔斯・达尔文 22 岁时，收到了作为博物学家乘坐 “贝格尔号” 航行的邀请。当时他无所事事，程度甚至让家人担心，所以才能接受邀请。而如果他没接受，我们可能根本不会知道他的名字。</p><p>[8] Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this department. There are some whose definition of important problems includes only those on the critical path to med school.</p><p>[8] 父母在这方面有时尤其保守。有些父母认为，只有通往医学院的关键路径上的问题才是重要的。</p><p>[9] I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring ideas intolerable. Could you endure studying literary theory, or working in middle management at a large company?</p><p>[9] 我确实想到了一个判断你是否对有趣的想法有感觉的方法：你是否无法忍受已知的无聊想法。你能忍受研究文学理论，或在大公司做中层管理吗？</p><p>[10] In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a job after college, they thought at least a little about how the courses they took might look to an employer. And perhaps even worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA. Good news: users don’t care what your GPA was. And I’ve never heard of investors caring either. Y Combinator certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades you got in them.</p><p>[10] 事实上，如果你的目标是创业，你可以比前几代人更贴近通识教育的理想。过去，学生主要关注毕业后找工作，至少会有点在意选的课程在雇主看来怎么样。甚至更糟，他们可能会避开难的课程，怕成绩低影响至关重要的 GPA。好消息是：用户不在乎你的 GPA，我也从没听说投资者在乎。YC 肯定不会问你大学上了什么课，成绩如何。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Superlinear-Returns"><a href="#Superlinear-Returns" class="headerlink" title="Superlinear Returns"></a>Superlinear Returns</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html">https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html</a></p><p>October 2023</p><p>One of the most important things I didn’t understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.</p><p>小时候，我对世界最不理解的一点是：绩效回报的超线性程度。</p><p>Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. “You get out,” I heard a thousand times, “what you put in.” They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor’s, you don’t get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.</p><p>老师和教练潜移默化地告诉我们，回报是线性的。“一分耕耘，一分收获”，这句话我听了上百遍。他们的初衷是好的，但这在现实中很少成立。如果你的产品只比竞争对手差一半，你不会只得到一半客户 —— 你会失去所有客户，最终倒闭。</p><p>It’s obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we’ve invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1]</p><p>在商业领域，绩效回报的超线性特征显而易见。有人认为这是资本主义的缺陷，觉得只要改变规则就能消除这种现象。但超线性回报是世界的固有特征，而非人类发明的规则所导致的偶然结果。在名气、权力、军事胜利、知识乃至对人类的贡献中，我们都能看到同样的模式：强者愈强。[1]</p><p>You can’t understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you’re ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.</p><p>不理解超线性回报，就无法理解世界。如果你有野心，就更该明白这一点 —— 因为这将是你可以借力的浪潮。</p><p>It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.</p><p>看似有很多场景都存在超线性回报，但在我看来，它们归根结底源于两个根本原因：指数增长和阈值。</p><p>The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you’re working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they’re tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who’s adept at it and someone who’s not is very great.</p><p>超线性回报最明显的例子，是当你在做一件呈指数增长的事。比如细菌培养：一旦开始增长，就是指数级的，但培养过程却很棘手。这意味着，擅长培养的人和不擅长的人，结果会有天壤之别。</p><p>Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don’t. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.</p><p>初创公司的增长也可能是指数级的，我们在其中看到了同样的模式：有些公司能实现高速增长，大多数则不能。结果就是，两类公司的结局有着质的区别：高速增长的公司往往会变得极具价值，而增长缓慢的公司可能连生存都成问题。</p><p>Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.</p><p>Y Combinator（创业孵化器）鼓励创始人关注增长率而非绝对数值。这能防止他们在早期因绝对数值低而气馁，也能帮助他们确定重点 —— 增长率可以作为指南针，指引公司如何发展。但最主要的好处是，聚焦增长率更容易实现指数级增长。</p><p>YC doesn’t explicitly tell founders that with growth rate “you get out what you put in,” but it’s not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to p^t.</p><p>Y Combinator 没有明确告诉创始人 “增长率与付出成正比”，但事实也相差不远。如果增长率与绩效成正比，那么绩效为 p、经过时间 t 后的回报，将与 pᵗ成正比。</p><p>Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling.</p><p>即便思考了几十年，我仍觉得这句话令人震惊。</p><p>Whenever how well you do depends on how well you’ve done, you’ll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.</p><p>只要 “做得有多好” 取决于 “已经做得有多好”，就会出现指数增长。但无论是我们的基因还是习俗，都没让我们做好应对指数增长的准备。没人觉得指数增长是 “自然” 的 —— 每个孩子第一次听到 “国王与米粒” 的故事（第一天要 1 粒米，之后每天翻倍）时，都会感到惊讶。</p><p>What we don’t understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don’t have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they’d have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.</p><p>对于我们天生不理解的事物，我们会形成习俗来应对，但关于指数增长的习俗却很少，因为人类历史上指数增长的案例寥寥无几。理论上，放牧本可以是一个例子：拥有的牲畜越多，后代就越多。但实际上，牧场是限制因素，而牧场的增长没有指数级的计划。</p><p>Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one’s territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn’t affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one’s own life.</p><p>或者更准确地说，没有普遍适用的计划。有一种方式可以让领土呈指数级扩张：征服。控制的领土越多，军队就越强大，征服新领土就越容易。这就是历史上帝国层出不穷的原因。但创建或管理帝国的人太少了，他们的经验几乎没影响到大众习俗。皇帝是遥远而可怕的存在，而非普通人可以借鉴的榜样。</p><p>The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn’t affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. [2]</p><p>前工业化时代最常见的指数增长案例可能是学术研究：知道的越多，学习新事物就越容易。结果就是，无论过去还是现在，总有人在某些领域的知识量远超他人。但这也没对习俗产生多少影响。尽管 “思想帝国” 可以重叠（因此能有更多 “皇帝”），但在前工业化时代，这类帝国几乎没有实际影响力。[2]</p><p>That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven’t fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they’re benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.</p><p>近几个世纪，情况变了。如今，思想领域的 “皇帝” 可以设计出击败领土 “皇帝” 的炸弹。但这种现象仍太新，我们尚未完全接纳它。即便是参与者，也很少有人意识到自己正受益于指数增长，或思考能从其他指数增长案例中借鉴什么。</p><p>The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression “winner take all.” In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [3]</p><p>超线性回报的另一个来源体现在 “赢者通吃” 这一说法中。在体育比赛中，绩效与回报的关系是阶梯式的：获胜的队伍无论表现远超对手还是仅略胜一筹，都只能得到一场胜利。[3]</p><p>The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It’s that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don’t need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you’re the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.</p><p>但阶梯函数的根源并非竞争本身，而是结果中存在阈值。即便没有竞争，阈值也可能存在 —— 比如证明一个定理或击中一个目标，这些只有唯一参与者的场景也有阈值。</p><p>It’s remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.</p><p>值得注意的是，一个存在超线性回报的场景，往往同时包含两种来源。跨越阈值会带来指数增长：战场上的获胜方通常损失更小，这让他们未来更可能获胜；而指数增长也会帮助你跨越阈值：在有网络效应的市场中，增长足够快的公司可以排挤潜在竞争对手。</p><p>Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it’s so concentrated is thresholds: there’s only so much room on the A-list in the average person’s head.</p><p>名气是一个同时包含两种来源的有趣例子。名气呈指数增长，因为现有粉丝会带来新粉丝；但名气高度集中的根本原因是阈值：普通人的脑海中，“一线明星” 的位置有限。</p><p>The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you’re able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.</p><p>学习可能是最能体现两种来源结合的重要案例。知识呈指数增长，同时也存在阈值 —— 比如学骑自行车。有些阈值类似 “机床”：一旦学会阅读，学习其他任何东西都会快得多。但最重要的阈值是那些代表新发现的节点。知识似乎是分形的：如果你在某个知识领域的边界深耕，有时会发现一整个新领域。而如果你做到了，你就有机会优先探索这个新领域中的所有发现。牛顿、丢勒、达尔文都是如此。</p><p>Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.</p><p>有没有找到超线性回报场景的通用规则？最明显的一条是：寻求有复利效应的工作。</p><p>There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you’re building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you’re doing badly as it’s happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you’re learning a lot, then you’re getting exponential growth nonetheless.</p><p>工作的复利效应有两种形式。一种是直接复利：一个周期做得好，会让下一个周期做得更好。比如建设基础设施、增长受众或打造品牌时，就会出现这种情况。另一种是通过学习产生的复利 —— 因为学习本身就是复利的。第二种情况很有趣：过程中你可能觉得自己做得很糟（比如没能实现即时目标），但只要学到了很多，你其实已经在实现指数增长了。</p><p>This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren’t blindly tolerant of failure. They’ll only continue to bet on you if you’re learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn’t grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.</p><p>这也是硅谷对失败如此宽容的原因之一。硅谷人并非盲目宽容失败：他们只会继续投资那些能从失败中学习的人。但如果你能做到，你就值得投资 —— 或许你的公司没按预期增长，但你自己成长了，最终总会有回报。</p><p>Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don’t consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you’re not learning, you’re probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.</p><p>事实上，不包含学习的指数增长，往往也与学习紧密交织，这更可能是常态而非例外。这带来了另一个启发：永远保持学习。如果不学习，你很可能不在通往超线性回报的道路上。</p><p>But don’t overoptimize what you’re learning. Don’t limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You’re learning; you don’t know for sure yet what’s going to be valuable, and if you’re too strict you’ll lop off the outliers.</p><p>但不要过度优化学习内容。不要只学已知有价值的东西。你在学习时，未必知道什么最终会有价值；如果限制太严，你会错过那些潜在的 “outliers”（极端值）。</p><p>What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form “seek thresholds” or “seek competition?” Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn’t guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you’ll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you’re no better off. “Seek competition” is similarly useless; what if the prize isn’t worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it’s trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape. [4]</p><p>那么阶梯函数呢？有没有 “寻求阈值” 或 “寻求竞争” 这样有用的启发？情况更复杂。存在阈值不代表这件事值得做。比如玩俄罗斯轮盘赌，确实有阈值，但最好的结果也只是没输 —— 这显然不值得。“寻求竞争” 同样没用：如果奖品不值一提呢？足够快的指数增长能同时保证回报曲线的形状和幅度（因为增长足够快的事物，即使起点微不足道，最终也会变得庞大），但阈值只能保证形状。[4]</p><p>A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here’s one that does: if you come across something that’s mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they’d buy a better alternative if you made one. [5]</p><p>利用阈值的原则必须包含一个检验：确保这件事值得做。有一个可行的原则：如果你遇到一件平庸却流行的事物，或许可以尝试取代它。比如，如果一家公司的产品人们不喜欢却仍在购买，那么只要你做出更好的替代品，人们很可能会买你的。[5]</p><p>It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there’s hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn’t likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they’d be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you’re supposed to.</p><p>如果能找到有前景的 “知识阈值” 就好了 —— 怎么判断哪些问题背后藏着全新领域？我怀疑我们永远无法确切预测，但这个 “奖品” 太有价值了，哪怕找到比随机猜测稍好的预测方法也是有用的，而这是有可能的。我们在某种程度上能预测哪些研究问题不太可能带来新发现：那些看似合理却枯燥的问题。而能带来新发现的问题，往往看起来很神秘，却可能被认为 “不重要”（如果既神秘又明显重要，它们会成为著名的开放问题，早就有很多人在研究了）。因此，这里的一个启发是：被好奇心驱动，而非功利心 —— 放纵你的好奇心，而不是只做 “应该做” 的事。</p><p>The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there’s good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing.</p><p>对有野心的人来说，绩效的超线性回报前景令人兴奋。还有一个好消息：这个领域正在双向扩张 —— 能获得超线性回报的工作类型更多了，回报本身也在增长。</p><p>There are two reasons for this, though they’re so closely intertwined that they’re more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.</p><p>原因有两个（但它们紧密交织，更像是一个半）：技术进步，以及组织的重要性下降。</p><p>Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren’t part of an organization, you weren’t likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences. [6]</p><p>50 年前，要从事有野心的项目，往往必须加入某个组织 —— 这是获得资源、同事和渠道的唯一方式。因此在 1970 年，一个人的声望在大多数情况下等同于所属组织的声望。而声望是准确的预测指标，因为如果不属于任何组织，你几乎不可能取得成就。只有少数例外，尤其是艺术家和作家 —— 他们用廉价工具独立工作，有自己的品牌。但即便是他们，也得依赖组织才能触达受众。[6]</p><p>A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don’t require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.</p><p>一个由组织主导的世界，会抑制绩效回报的差异。但在我有生之年，这个世界已大幅瓦解。现在，更多人能拥有 20 世纪艺术家和作家那样的自由：很多有野心的项目不需要太多初始资金，还有很多新方式可以学习、赚钱、寻找同事和触达受众。</p><p>There’s still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what’s at stake. It’s hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance.</p><p>旧世界的痕迹仍在，但以历史标准来看，变化速度惊人 —— 尤其是考虑到其中的利害关系。很难想象有什么变化比 “绩效回报方式” 的变化更根本。</p><p>Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn’t imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That’s an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they’re so good that they’ll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out. [7]</p><p>没有了机构的抑制作用，结果的差异会更大。这并不意味着所有人都会过得更好：做得好的人会更好，做得差的人会更差。这一点很重要。并非所有人都适合追求超线性回报 —— 大多数人作为 “群体中的一员” 会更好。那么谁该追求超线性回报？两类有野心的人：一类是知道自己足够优秀，能在高差异世界中最终受益的人；另一类是（尤其是年轻人）能承担风险去尝试的人。[7]</p><p>The switch away from institutions won’t simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they’d never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.</p><p>脱离机构的过程不会只是现有成员的 “大逃亡”。许多新赢家会是那些机构永远不会接纳的人。因此，机会的民主化将比机构内部温和的 “内部改革” 更彻底、更真实。</p><p>Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. [8] But if you’re an ambitious individual it’s good news for you. How should you take advantage of it?</p><p>并非所有人都对这种 “野心的释放” 感到高兴。它威胁到一些既得利益，也与一些意识形态冲突。[8] 但如果你是有野心的个体，这就是好消息。该如何利用这个机会？</p><p>The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there’s less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it’s hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it’s not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.</p><p>利用绩效超线性回报最明显的方式，是做极其出色的工作。在曲线的末端，增量努力是 “划算的”。更重要的是，末端的竞争更少 —— 不仅因为把事情做到极致很难，还因为人们觉得这个前景太吓人，很少有人敢尝试。这意味着，不仅做卓越的工作是划算的，哪怕只是尝试去做，也是划算的。</p><p>There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it’s even more valuable to know what you’re interested in, and to find ways to work on it. [9] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there’s a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you’re young and don’t yet have children.</p><p>影响工作质量的变量有很多，如果你想成为 “outliers”，几乎要把所有变量都做好。比如，要把一件事做到极致，你必须对它有兴趣 —— 光靠勤奋不够。因此，在一个超线性回报的世界里，知道自己对什么感兴趣、并找到为之工作的方式，变得更有价值。[9] 选择适合自身处境的工作也很重要。比如，如果一种工作本身需要投入大量时间和精力，那么在年轻、还没有孩子时去做，价值会越来越高。</p><p>There’s a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It’s not just a matter of trying hard. I’m going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph.</p><p>做好工作有很多技巧，不只是 “努力”。我试着用一段话总结：</p><p>Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn’t matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they’re full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you’re lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you’re not failing occasionally you’re probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what’s worth paying attention to. [10]</p><p>选择你有天赋且深感兴趣的工作。养成做自己项目的习惯 —— 项目是什么不重要，只要你觉得它有令人兴奋的野心。在不 burnout（ burnout：过度劳累）的前提下全力以赴，这最终会带你到达知识的某个前沿。远处看，前沿是平滑的；近处看，满是缺口。留意并探索这些缺口，运气好的话，某个缺口会扩展成一整个新领域。承担你能承受的风险 —— 如果从未失败，你可能太保守了。寻找最优秀的同事。培养好品味，向最好的例子学习。诚实（尤其是对自己）。锻炼、健康饮食、睡好，远离危险药物。有疑问时，跟随好奇心 —— 它从不说谎，比你更知道什么值得关注。[10]</p><p>And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it’s even more of a factor when you’re working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there’s also a component of true chance that you can’t do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.</p><p>当然，你还需要一样东西：运气。运气永远是因素，但当你独立工作而非加入组织时，运气的影响更大。尽管有 “运气是准备遇上机会” 这样的格言，但确实存在你无法控制的纯粹偶然。解决办法是多尝试 —— 这也是早点开始冒险的另一个原因。</p><p>The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge.</p><p>最能体现超线性回报的领域可能是科学。它既有学习带来的指数增长，又在绩效的极端边缘（即知识的极限）存在阈值。</p><p>The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton’s discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries’ combined. [11]</p><p>结果就是，科学发现的不平等程度，让即便是最分层社会的财富不平等都相形见绌。牛顿的发现，可以说超过了同时代所有人的总和。[11]</p><p>This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.</p><p>这一点看似明显，但不妨说清楚：超线性回报意味着不平等。回报曲线越陡峭，结果的差异就越大。</p><p>In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.</p><p>事实上，超线性回报与不平等的相关性极强，这带来了另一个寻找这类工作的启发：看那些 “少数大赢家远超其他人” 的领域。如果一个领域里所有人的表现都差不多，那它不太可能有超线性回报。</p><p>What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. [12]</p><p>哪些领域是 “少数大赢家远超其他人” 的？ obvious 的有：体育、政治、艺术、音乐、表演、导演、写作、数学、科学、创业和投资。体育中的这种现象源于外部设定的阈值 —— 你只需要快百分之几，就能赢得所有比赛。政治中的权力增长，和古代帝国时代类似。而在其他一些领域（包括政治），成功很大程度上由名气驱动，而名气本身就有超线性增长的来源。但如果排除体育、政治和名气的影响，会出现一个明显的模式：剩下的领域，恰好是那些需要 “独立思考” 才能成功的领域 —— 你的想法不仅要正确，还要新颖。[12]</p><p>This is obviously the case in science. You can’t publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it’s just as true in investing, for example. It’s only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don’t; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there’s no room to make money.</p><p>科学领域显然如此：你不能发表别人已经说过的话。投资领域也一样：只有当大多数投资者不看好一家公司时，你相信它会成功才有意义；如果所有人都看好，股价早已反映这一点，你就没机会赚钱了。</p><p>What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I’ll never get anywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it’s worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.</p><p>从这些领域中，我们还能学到什么？在所有这些领域，你都必须付出初始努力。超线性回报在初期看起来微不足道。你可能会想：“这样下去，我永远也成不了事。” 但因为回报曲线在末端会急剧上升，付出非凡努力到达那里是值得的。</p><p>In the startup world, the name for this principle is “do things that don’t scale.” If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you’ll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it’s worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.</p><p>在创业圈，这个原则被称为 “做不规模化的事”。如果你对最初的少量客户投入极大关注，理想情况下，就能通过口碑启动指数增长。这个原则适用于所有指数增长的事物 —— 比如学习。刚开始学东西时，你会感到迷茫，但付出初始努力站稳脚跟是值得的，因为学得越多，就越容易。</p><p>There’s another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we’ve inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase “your work” means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they’re currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it’s part of their portfolio.</p><p>从有超线性回报的领域列表中，还能得到一个更微妙的启示：不要把 “工作” 等同于 “职业”。20 世纪的大多数人，工作和职业是一回事，因此我们继承了 “生产力等同于有一份职业” 的习俗。即便是现在，对大多数人来说，“你的工作” 指的是你的职业。但对作家、艺术家或科学家来说，“工作” 是他们当前研究或创作的任何东西。对这类人来说，工作是他们从一个职业带到另一个职业的东西（如果他们有职业的话）。工作可能是为雇主做的，但属于他们自己的 “作品集”。</p><p>It’s an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don’t need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you’ll end up in one. Your curiosity won’t let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they’re not already part of one.</p><p>进入一个 “少数大赢家远超其他人” 的领域，前景确实令人畏惧。有些人会刻意这么做，但你不必。如果你有足够的天赋，且跟随好奇心走得足够远，你自然会进入这样的领域。你的好奇心不会让你对无聊的问题感兴趣，而有趣的问题如果还不属于某个领域，往往会催生出有超线性回报的领域。</p><p>The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.</p><p>超线性回报的领域绝非静止不变。事实上，最极端的回报来自于拓展这个领域。因此，尽管野心和好奇心都能带你进入这个领域，但好奇心可能更强大。野心往往让你攀登已有的山峰，而如果你紧紧盯着一个足够有趣的问题，它可能会在你脚下长成一座山。</p><p>Notes</p><p>There’s a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they’re not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they’re not meaningless. I’ve tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error.</p><p>“努力”“绩效”“回报” 之间的界限很难严格区分，因为它们在现实中本就模糊。对一个人来说是 “回报” 的东西，对另一个人可能是 “绩效”。但尽管这些概念的边界模糊，它们并非没有意义。我已尽量精确地描述它们，避免错误。</p><p>[1] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we’re not the recipients; we’re the returns.</p><p>[1] 进化本身可能是绩效超线性回报最普遍的例子。但我们很难共情，因为我们不是接受者，而是回报本身。</p><p>[2] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people.</p><p>[2] 当然，工业革命前，知识也有实际影响。农业的发展彻底改变了人类生活。但这种变化是技术广泛、渐进改进的结果，而非少数极有学识的人的发现。</p><p>[3] It’s not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother.</p><p>[3] 从数学上讲，阶梯函数并非超线性，但当阶梯函数从 0 开始、描述理性行为者的努力回报曲线时，它的作用类似超线性函数。如果从 0 开始，阶梯前的部分低于任何线性增长的回报，而阶梯后的部分必须高于该点的必要回报，否则没人会去做。</p><p>[4] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It’s also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it’s a sign that other people find them promising. But it’s a very imperfect sign: often there’s a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one.</p><p>[4] “寻求竞争” 在某种意义上可能是个好启发：有些人觉得竞争能激励自己。它也能在一定程度上指引有前景的问题，因为这表明其他人也觉得它们有前景。但这是个很不完美的信号：往往有一群人追捧某个问题，最终却被一个默默研究其他问题的人超越。</p><p>[5] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there’s often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons.</p><p>[5] 但也不总是这样。这个规则需要谨慎使用。当一件事平庸却流行时，往往有隐藏原因：可能是垄断或监管让竞争变难，可能是客户品味差，或决策流程有问题。有大量平庸的事物因这些原因存在。</p><p>[6] In my twenties I wanted to be an artist and even went to art school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations.<br>[6] 我二十多岁时想当艺术家，甚至去艺术学校学绘画。主要是因为我喜欢艺术，但也有个重要原因：艺术家似乎最不受组织支配。</p><p>[7] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep.</p><p>[7] 理论上，每个人都在获得超线性回报。学习是复利的，每个人一生中都在学习。但实际上，很少有人把这种日常学习推进到回报曲线真正陡峭的程度。</p><p>[8] It’s unclear exactly what advocates of “equity” mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else.</p><p>[8] “公平” 的倡导者到底指什么，尚不清楚。他们内部似乎也有分歧。但无论指什么，都可能与 “机构对结果的控制力下降、少数异类远超其他人” 的世界相冲突。</p><p>It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don’t think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance.</p><p>这个概念恰好在世界向相反方向转变时出现，看似巧合，但我不这么认为。我觉得它现在出现的一个原因是，其支持者感受到了绩效差异快速扩大的威胁。</p><p>[9] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.</p><p>[9] 推论：父母强迫孩子从事有 prestige（ prestige：声望）的工作（比如医学），哪怕孩子毫无兴趣，这对孩子的伤害会比过去更大。</p><p>[10] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of “How to Do Great Work.” As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished “How to Do Great Work” I rewrote it based on that.</p><p>[10] 这段话的初稿是《如何做好工作》的第一版。写完后我意识到，这个主题比超线性回报更重要，于是暂停本文，把这段话扩展成了独立文章。现在的版本几乎没保留初稿内容，因为写完《如何做好工作》后，我据此重写了这段话。</p><p>[11] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio has shifted dramatically toward discovery just in the last half century.</p><p>[11] 工业革命前，富人致富的方式通常和皇帝一样：夺取资源让他们更强大，进而夺取更多资源。现在，还可以像科学家一样：发现或创造独特的价值。大多数富人会混合新旧方式，但在最发达的经济体中，过去半个世纪里，“发现” 的占比已大幅上升。</p><p>[12] It’s not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it’s not simply that they don’t want anyone to have what they can’t. The conventional-minded literally can’t imagine what it’s like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence.</p><p>[12] 如果独立思考是不平等的一大驱动因素，那么循规蹈矩的人不喜欢不平等就不奇怪了。但这不只是因为他们不希望别人拥有自己没有的东西。循规蹈矩的人根本无法想象有新颖想法是什么感觉。因此，绩效的巨大差异在他们看来是不自然的，遇到时会认为一定是作弊或有恶意外部影响。</p>]]></content>

    <title>疯狂的新想法</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crazy-New-Ideas"><a href="#Crazy-New-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Crazy New Ideas"></a>Crazy New Ideas</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/newideas.html">https://paulgraham.com/newideas.html</a></p><p>May 2021</p><p>There’s one kind of opinion I’d be very afraid to express publicly. If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I’d be very reluctant to say “That will never work.”</p><p>有一种观点，我非常害怕公开表达。但如果我认识的一个人，既是某领域的专家，又通情达理，却提出了一个听起来荒谬绝伦的想法，我绝不会轻易说 “这根本行不通”。</p><p>Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that’s how big things start. Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world.</p><p>任何研究过思想史（尤其是科学史）的人都知道，伟大的事物往往始于此：有人提出一个听起来疯狂的想法，多数人嗤之鼻，最终它却逐渐改变了世界。</p><p>Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they’re proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they’re proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don’t. And if they have deep domain expertise, that’s probably the source of it. [1]</p><p>多数听起来难以置信的想法确实糟糕，完全可以放心否定。但如果提出者是通情达理的领域专家，情况就不同了。一个理智的人必然清楚自己的想法有多离谱，却仍坚持提出 —— 这说明他们知道一些你不知道的事。而如果他们拥有深厚的领域知识，那很可能就是答案的来源。[1]</p><p>Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed. There’s something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it’s boring to evidence that it’s exciting. [2]</p><p>这类想法不仅不该被轻易否定，反而更可能暗藏价值。普通人提出离谱的想法，其 “离谱” 恰恰证明了他们的无能；但换成通情达理的领域专家，情况就完全反转了。这有点像 “有效市场”：平均来看，那些看似最疯狂的想法，一旦正确，影响往往最大。所以，如果你能排除 “提出离谱想法的人是无能的” 这一可能，那么 “离谱” 就会从 “无聊” 的证据，变成 “令人兴奋” 的信号。[2]</p><p>Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don’t have to be. They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently high expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable domain experts, you’d end up net ahead.</p><p>这类想法未必一定可行，但这没关系。它们只需是 “足够好的赌注”—— 拥有足够高的预期价值。而我认为，总体来看它们确实如此。如果你押注于所有由通情达理的领域专家提出的离谱想法，最终很可能会净赚。</p><p>The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word “paradigm” is overused, but this is a case where it’s warranted. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they’ve already subjected them to an excessively strict filter. [3]</p><p>原因在于，所有人都过于保守。“范式” 这个词被滥用了，但这里用它恰如其分：每个人都深陷当前范式的桎梏，即便提出新想法的人，最初也会低估自己的想法。这意味着，在他们公开提出这些想法之前，已经用过于严苛的标准过滤过了。[3]</p><p>The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions, because there’s a real mystery here. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you’re the one who’s mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there’s a hole in your model of the world. But even if they’re mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.</p><p>面对这类想法，明智的反应不是下结论，而是提问 —— 因为这里存在一个真正的谜团：为什么这个聪明又理智的人会提出一个看似错误的想法？是他们错了，还是你错了？总有一方是错的。如果错的是你，了解这一点会很有价值，因为这意味着你的世界观存在漏洞；即便错的是他们，弄清楚原因也很有趣 —— 专家掉进去的陷阱，你也可能遇到。</p><p>This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of people who don’t share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead of just reserving judgement?</p><p>这一切似乎显而易见。但显然，很多人并不像我这样害怕否定新想法。他们为什么要这么做？为什么宁愿现在显得粗鲁、日后显得愚蠢，也不愿暂时保留判断？</p><p>One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong.</p><p>一个原因是嫉妒。如果你提出一个激进的新想法并成功了，你的声誉（或许还有财富）会随之飙升。有些人会因此嫉妒，这种潜在的嫉妒会转化为 “你肯定错了” 的执念。</p><p>Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it’s an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It’s a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. So it’s easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don’t understand this asymmetry.</p><p>另一个原因是，否定新想法是彰显 “老练” 的捷径。新想法刚出现时，往往显得脆弱不堪，就像刚破壳的雏鸟；而既有观念则如同展翅的雄鹰。所以，攻击新想法很容易显得 “有见地”—— 对不了解这种不对称的人来说，这么做的人看起来很聪明。</p><p>This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. So it’s worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.</p><p>这种现象因 “研究新想法者” 与 “攻击新想法者” 的回报差异而加剧：研究新想法的回报与结果价值挂钩 —— 如果一件事成功后能带来 10 倍以上的改善，即便只有 10% 的成功率，也值得投入；而攻击新想法的回报几乎是固定的 —— 无论攻击的对象是什么，这种行为看起来 “聪明” 的程度都差不多。</p><p>People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. It’s not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin’s harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers on some ideas. When someone claims they’re false or obsolete, they feel threatened.</p><p>人们还会因为 “旧想法的既得利益” 而攻击新想法。比如，达尔文最严厉的批评者中有些是神职人员，这并不奇怪。有些人的整个职业生涯都建立在某些想法之上，当有人说这些想法是错的或过时的，他们会感到威胁。</p><p>The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.</p><p>最低级的否定是纯粹的派系主义：自动否定所有与对立派系相关的想法。而最最低级的，是因为提出者是谁而否定一个想法。</p><p>But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn’t just affect the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance. [4]</p><p>但让理智的人否定新想法的主要原因，与阻碍人们提出新想法的原因相同：当前范式的无处不在。它不仅影响我们的思考方式，更是我们构建思想的 “乐高积木”。能跳出当前范式的人寥寥无几，即便他们，最初也往往要压制直觉 —— 就像飞行员穿越云层时，必须相信仪器而非平衡感。[4]</p><p>Paradigms don’t just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn’t till the mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor. [5]</p><p>范式不仅定义了我们当下的思考，还 “吸走” 了通往它们的轨迹，让我们对新想法的标准高得离谱。作为范式的 “后代”，我们觉得它完美无缺，甚至以为它一经提出就被完全接受 —— 比如，无论教会怎么看待日心说，天文学家在哥白尼提出时肯定立刻信服了。但事实远非如此：哥白尼 1532 年发表日心说，直到 17 世纪中叶，科学界的主流观点才转向支持它。[5]</p><p>Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when they’re born. Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the heads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when the new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was only half-convinced it was right?</p><p>很少有人知道新想法刚出现时有多脆弱。所以，如果你自己也想产生新想法，最有价值的事之一就是了解它们 “诞生时的样子”：去读新想法的发展史，试着代入当时的人的视角 —— 当新想法还未成熟，连提出者自己都只有一半把握时，他们眼中的世界是什么样的？</p><p>But you don’t have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideas being born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonable domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.</p><p>但你不必只局限于历史。现在，你身边就有重大新想法正在诞生。只需留意：那些通情达理的领域专家，正在提出哪些听起来 “错误” 的东西。</p><p>If you’re nice, as well as wise, you won’t merely resist attacking such people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely business. Only those who’ve tried it know how lonely. These people need your help. And if you help them, you’ll probably learn something in the process.</p><p>如果你兼具明智与善良，不仅不会攻击这些人，还会鼓励他们。产生新想法是一件孤独的事，只有尝试过的人才懂这份孤独。这些人需要你的帮助，而帮助他们的过程中，你很可能也会有所收获。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] This domain expertise could be in another field. Indeed, such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.</p><p>[1] 这里的 “领域知识” 可能来自其他领域。事实上，这种跨领域的想法往往特别有潜力。</p><p>[2] I’m not claiming this principle extends much beyond math, engineering, and the hard sciences. In politics, for example, crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. Though arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon. Perhaps no one could be.</p><p>[2] 我并非说这一原则适用于数学、工程学和硬科学之外的领域。比如在政治中，听起来疯狂的想法通常确实很糟糕。但这或许不算例外，因为提出这些想法的人并非真正的领域专家：政客是 “政治策略”（如如何当选、如何推动立法）的专家，而非 “政策所作用的世界” 的专家。或许，没人能成为后者。</p><p>[3] This sense of “paradigm” was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientific Revolutions, but I also recommend his Copernican Revolution, where you can see him at work developing the idea.</p><p>[3] “范式” 的这一含义由托马斯・库恩在《科学革命的结构》中定义，但我也推荐他的《哥白尼革命》，在这本书中可以看到他如何逐步发展这一概念。</p><p>[4] This is one reason people with a touch of Asperger’s may have an advantage in discovering new ideas. They’re always flying on instruments.</p><p>[4] 这也是为什么有轻微阿斯伯格综合征的人可能在发现新想法上更有优势 —— 他们总是 “依靠仪器飞行”。</p><p>[5] Hall, Rupert. From Galileo to Newton. Collins, 1963. This book is particularly good at getting into contemporaries’ heads.</p><p>[5] 霍尔・鲁珀特，《从伽利略到牛顿》，柯林斯出版社，1963 年。这本书特别擅长代入同时代人的视角。</p>]]></content>

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.</p><p>自 1982 年起，《福布斯》杂志每年都会发布美国富豪榜。对比 1982 年和 2020 年榜单中最富有的 100 人，我们会发现一些显著差异。</p><p>In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.</p><p>1982 年，最常见的财富来源是继承。在最富有的 100 人中，60 人的财富来自先辈遗产，仅杜邦家族的继承人就有 10 位。而到 2020 年，继承财富的人数减少了一半，仅占前 100 名富豪的 27%。</p><p>Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them.</p><p>为什么继承财富的比例会下降？并非因为遗产税提高 —— 事实上，这段时间遗产税大幅降低。真正的原因不是继承巨额财富的人变少了，而是靠自己创造财富的人变多了。</p><p>How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3&#x2F;4 by starting companies and 1&#x2F;4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders’ or early employees’ equity (52 founders, 2 early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing investment funds.</p><p>这些新富豪是如何发家的？约 3&#x2F;4 来自创办公司，1&#x2F;4 来自投资。2020 年的 73 位新富豪中，56 位来自创始人或早期员工的股权（52 位创始人、2 位早期员工、2 位创始人的妻子），17 位来自管理投资基金。</p><p>There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982. Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with their money. [1]</p><p>1982 年的美国前 100 富豪中，没有基金经理。尽管 1982 年就有对冲基金和私募股权公司，但它们的创始人当时还不够富有，无法跻身前 100。后来有两件事改变了这一点：基金经理发现了创造高回报的新方法，且更多投资者愿意把钱交给他们管理。[1]</p><p>But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because the companies do different things.</p><p>但如今新财富的主要来源是创办公司，数据显示这方面也发生了巨大变化。现在通过创办公司致富的人比 1982 年更富有，因为这些公司所从事的领域不同了。</p><p>In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oil.</p><p>1982 年，新富豪有两个主要来源：石油和房地产。在当年的 40 位新富豪中，至少 24 位主要来自石油或房地产。而现在，这类富豪占比很小：2020 年的 73 位新富豪中，仅 4 笔来自房地产，2 笔来自石油。</p><p>By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called “tech” companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type.</p><p>到 2020 年，新富豪的最大来源是所谓的 “科技” 公司。73 位新富豪中，约 30 位来自这类公司。它们在顶级富豪中尤为常见：2020 年前 10 大富豪中，有 8 位来自科技公司。</p><p>Arguably it’s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn’t Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won’t seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?</p><p>将 “科技” 视为一个类别可能略有误导。亚马逊难道不是零售商吗？特斯拉不是汽车制造商吗？可以说是，也可以说不是。或许 50 年后，当我们如今所说的 “科技” 成为常态，把这两家公司归为同一类别就显得不合适了。但至少目前，它们确实有一些共同的、能与其他公司区分开的特质。哪家零售商会推出 AWS（亚马逊云服务）？哪家汽车制造商的老板同时还经营着一家火箭公司？</p><p>The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the sense that they’re all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others mostly not. And there’s a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who’s really driven and good at making deals.</p><p>支撑前 100 富豪财富的科技公司，其实是一个界限清晰的群体 —— 风险投资家愿意投资它们，而其他公司大多不被青睐。原因在于：这些公司的成功主要靠更先进的技术，而非仅仅靠一位干劲十足、擅长做交易的 CEO。</p><p>To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn’t win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. [2] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals.</p><p>从这个角度看，科技公司的崛起代表着一种质的变化。1982 年《福布斯》400 富豪榜中的石油和房地产大亨，并非靠更先进的技术成功，而是靠干劲和交易能力。[2] 事实上，这种致富方式非常古老，甚至早于工业革命。16、17 世纪为欧洲王室（名义上）服务而致富的廷臣，通常也是靠干劲和交易能力。</p><p>People who don’t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn’t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don’t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?</p><p>那些只看基尼系数的人，会把 1982 年的世界视为 “美好旧时光”，因为当时的富豪没那么富。但如果深究他们的致富方式，“旧时光” 就没那么美好了。1982 年，前 100 富豪中 84% 的人靠继承、开采自然资源或房地产交易致富。这真的比现在富豪靠创办科技公司致富更好吗？</p><p>Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it’s misphrased. We shouldn’t be asking why people are starting companies, but why they’re starting companies again. [3]</p><p>为什么现在创办新公司的人比过去多得多，且能通过创办公司变得如此富有？说来奇怪，第一个问题的表述有误。我们不该问 “为什么人们开始创办公司”，而该问 “为什么人们又开始创办公司了”。[3]</p><p>In 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of the new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff found that “many of the richest … gained their initial edge from the new technology of mass production.” [4]</p><p>1892 年，《纽约先驱论坛报》编制了一份美国百万富翁名单，共 4047 人。当时靠继承财富的有多少？仅约 20%，比现在继承财富的比例还低。若深究当时新财富的来源，1892 年与现在更为相似。休・罗克夫发现：“许多最富有的人…… 最初的优势来自大规模生产这一新技术。”[4]</p><p>So it’s not 2020 that’s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald Tribune’s list was being compiled, a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, “the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.” [5]</p><p>因此，反常的不是 2020 年，而是 1982 年。真正的问题是：为什么 1982 年靠创办公司致富的人如此之少？答案是，就在《纽约先驱论坛报》编制名单时，一波整合浪潮正席卷美国经济。19 世纪末 20 世纪初，像 J.P. 摩根这样的金融家将数千家小公司合并成几百家巨头企业，这些巨头凭借规模经济占据主导地位。正如迈克尔・林德所写，到二战结束时，“经济的主要领域要么被政府支持的卡特尔组织控制，要么被少数寡头企业主导”。[5]</p><p>In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a viable option. You couldn’t break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at an existing one. [6]</p><p>1960 年，如今大多数创办初创公司的人，当时都会去这些巨头企业工作。1890 年和 2020 年，人们可以靠创办自己的公司致富，但 1960 年这并非可行选项 —— 你无法突破寡头垄断进入市场。因此，1960 年的主流路径不是创办公司，而是在现有企业中顺着职业阶梯往上爬。[6]</p><p>Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality (and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that respect. J. P. Morgan’s economy turned out to be just a phase, and starting in the 1970s, it began to break up.</p><p>让所有人都成为企业员工，降低了经济不平等（以及其他各种差异），但如果把 20 世纪中期视为 “常态”，那这种认知就大错特错了。J.P. 摩根主导的经济终究只是一个阶段，从 20 世纪 70 年代开始，它开始瓦解。</p><p>Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a process they called “deregulation,” to roll back the policies that propped up the oligopolies.</p><p>为什么会瓦解？部分原因是衰老。1930 年看似高效的巨头企业，到 1970 年已变得松弛臃肿。1970 年，僵化的经济结构中充斥着各种 “安乐窝”，不同群体借此隔绝市场力量。卡特政府时期，联邦政府意识到问题，开始通过 “ deregulation”（放松管制）撤销支撑寡头垄断的政策。</p><p>But it wasn’t just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan’s economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new technology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to punch right through the middle.</p><p>但瓦解 J.P. 摩根式经济的，不仅是内部衰败，还有外部压力 —— 以新技术（尤其是微电子技术）的形式。最形象的比喻是：想象一个池塘，表面结着一层冰。起初，从池底到水面只能绕着边缘走。但随着冰层变薄，你开始能直接从中间破冰而出。</p><p>The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being in the electronics or software business. When you used the word “startup” in 1990, that was what you meant. But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and car companies. [7]</p><p>池塘的边缘是纯科技领域：那些自称从事电子或软件业务的公司。1990 年提到 “初创公司” 时，指的就是这类企业。但现在，初创公司正直接从冰层中央破冰，取代零售商、电视网络、汽车制造商等老牌企业。[7]</p><p>But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan’s economy created a new world in the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the social sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century, it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies is a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize it’s actually the default. So what we should expect in the future is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup.</p><p>尽管 J.P. 摩根式经济的瓦解在技术层面创造了新世界，但在社会层面，它其实是回归常态。若只回顾 20 世纪中期，会觉得靠创办公司致富是近年才有的现象；但看得更远就会发现，这其实是默认状态。因此，未来我们有望看到更多类似情况 —— 事实上，创始人的数量和财富都可能增长，因为每十年，创办初创公司都变得更容易。</p><p>Part of the reason it’s getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won’t freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it’s easier to start a startup now is that it’s cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers.</p><p>创办初创公司变得更容易，部分原因与社会有关。社会正在（重新）接纳这一概念：现在创办公司，父母不会像上一代那样大惊小怪，且关于如何创业的知识也更普及。但主要原因是成本降低：技术压低了产品研发和客户获取的成本。</p><p>The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the balance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors’ permission to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders need investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of venture capital available, has driven up valuations. [8]</p><p>创业成本降低，反过来改变了创始人与投资者的权力平衡。过去，创办公司意味着建工厂，你完全需要投资者的许可才能启动；但现在，投资者更需要创始人，再加上风险资本越来越多，推高了公司估值。[8]</p><p>So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number of rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them, and that those who do can raise money on better terms.</p><p>因此，创业成本降低从两方面增加了富人数量：更多人会去创业，且创业者能以更有利的条件融资。</p><p>But there’s also a third factor at work: the companies themselves are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than they used to. Technology hasn’t just made it cheaper to build and distribute things, but faster too.</p><p>还有第三个因素：公司本身更有价值，因为新创办的公司比过去增长得更快。技术不仅让研发和分销成本更低，还让速度更快。</p><p>This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. [9]</p><p>这一趋势已持续很久。1896 年成立的 IBM，花了 45 年才实现按 2020 年美元计算的 10 亿美元营收；1939 年成立的惠普，用了 25 年；1975 年成立的微软，用了 13 年。现在，快速增长的公司通常只需 7 到 8 年。[9]</p><p>Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders’ stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.</p><p>快速增长对创始人股票的价值有双重影响：公司价值取决于营收和增长率。因此，公司增长越快，不仅能更快达到 10 亿美元营收，且达到这一规模时的价值也比增长慢的公司更高。</p><p>That’s why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.</p><p>这就是为什么现在的创始人有时能在年轻时就变得极其富有。创业初期成本低，意味着创始人可以早起步；而如今公司增长快，意味着一旦成功，几年后他们就可能意外暴富。</p><p>It’s easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don’t have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America’s Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be?</p><p>现在创办和发展公司，比以往任何时候都更容易。这意味着更多人会去创业，创业者能从投资者那里获得更有利的条件，最终诞生的公司也更有价值。一旦理解了这些机制，且知道初创公司在 20 世纪大部分时间里被压制，就不必用 “里根执政时期国家转向保守” 这种模糊说法来解释美国基尼系数的上升了。基尼系数上升是必然的 —— 更多人创办了更有价值的公司，怎么可能不上升呢？</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by the Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in them, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the top 100 fortunes in 1982.</p><p>[1] 1978 年，美国劳工部出台监管改革，允许养老基金投资于投资公司，此后投资公司迅速发展。但到 1982 年，这种发展的影响尚未体现在前 100 名富豪的财富中。</p><p>[2] George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though really driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to figure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale.</p><p>[2] 乔治・米切尔是个值得一提的例外。尽管他干劲十足且擅长交易，但他也是首位想出如何用水力压裂法从页岩中开采天然气的人。</p><p>[3] When I say people are starting more companies, I mean the type of company meant to grow very big. There has actually been a decrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new companies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and service businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer shoe stores and barber shops.</p><p>[3] 我说 “人们创办的公司更多了”，指的是那些旨在发展成大型企业的公司。事实上，过去几十年，新公司的总数有所减少，但绝大多数公司都是小型零售和服务企业。因此，“新企业数量减少” 的统计数据，实际意味着人们创办的鞋店和理发店等小型生意变少了。</p><p>People sometimes get confused when they see a graph labelled “startups” that’s going down, because there are two senses of the word “startup”: (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean startup in sense (1), not sense (2).</p><p>人们看到标有 “初创公司”（startups）且呈下降趋势的图表时，有时会感到困惑，因为 “startup” 一词有两种含义：（1）泛指公司的创立；（2）特指旨在快速发展成大型企业的一类公司。上述统计数据中的 “startup” 指的是第一种含义，而非第二种。</p><p>[4] Rockoff, Hugh. “Great Fortunes of the Gilded Age.” NBER Working Paper 14555, 2008.</p><p>[4] 罗克夫，休。《镀金时代的巨额财富》。NBER 工作论文 14555，2008 年。</p><p>[5] Lind, Michael. Land of Promise. HarperCollins, 2012.</p><p>[5] 林德，迈克尔。《希望之地》。哈珀柯林斯出版社，2012 年。</p><p>It’s also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century deterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one’s own company is risky, and when risk isn’t rewarded, people opt for safety instead.</p><p>20 世纪中期的高税率也可能抑制了人们创办自己的公司。创办公司具有风险，而当风险得不到回报时，人们会选择更安全的选项。</p><p>But it wasn’t simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax rates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes are not just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the people getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and oil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made their effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been more common to grow big companies by building new technology, the people doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as well.</p><p>但这并非简单的因果关系。20 世纪中期的寡头垄断与高税率是相辅相成的。较低的税率不仅是创业的原因，也是创业的结果：20 世纪中期靠房地产和石油勘探致富的人，通过游说获得了巨大的税收漏洞，使他们的实际税率低得多。想必，如果当时通过研发新技术发展大公司的情况更普遍，从事这类事业的人也会为自己争取税收漏洞。</p><p>[6] That’s why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th century so often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those were the two big areas of the economy that weren’t susceptible to consolidation.</p><p>[6] 这就是为什么 20 世纪中期真正致富的人，往往靠石油勘探或房地产 —— 这是经济中两个不易被整合的主要领域。</p><p>[7] The pure tech companies used to be called “high technology” startups. But now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust, we don’t need a separate name for the edges, and the term “high-tech” has a decidedly retro sound.</p><p>[7] 纯粹的科技公司过去被称为 “高科技”（high technology）初创公司。但如今，初创公司已能从 “冰层中央” 破冰而出，我们不再需要为 “边缘领域” 单独命名，“高科技” 一词也显然带有复古意味了。</p><p>[8] Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a given amount of money, or get more money for a given amount of stock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer if you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company more successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before the next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shoulds though. In practice a lot of money slips through them.</p><p>[8] 更高的估值意味着：要获得一定数额的资金，你要么少出售股票，要么以相同的股票份额获得更多资金。典型的初创公司会两者兼顾。显然，保留更多股票会让你更富有，但筹集更多资金理论上也会让你更富有，原因是：（a）这应能让公司更成功；（b）你能在下次融资前支撑更久，甚至可能不再需要下一轮融资。不过注意这些 “应能”—— 实际上，很多资金会在过程中流失</p><p>It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays contradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But there’s no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are the ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the ones doing it because they need the money to survive. There’s nothing like not needing money to make people offer it to you.</p><p>如今初创公司筹集的巨额资金，似乎与 “创业成本降低” 的说法矛盾，但两者并不冲突：筹集资金最多的初创公司，是主动选择融资以加速增长，而非因生存需要被迫融资。没有什么比 “不需要钱” 更能让别人主动给你钱了。</p><p>You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to be. You can almost hear them saying “No, no, not that way.”</p><p>近两个世纪以来，极左翼一直站在劳工这边与资本对抗，你可能会认为，当劳工最终占上风时，他们会感到高兴。但似乎没人高兴。你几乎能听到他们在说：“不，不，不是这样的。”</p><p>[9] IBM was created in 1911 by merging three companies, the most important of which was Herman Hollerith’s Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896. In 1941 its revenues were $60 million.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard’s revenues in 1964 were $125 million.</p><p>Microsoft’s revenues in 1988 were $590 million.</p><p>[9] IBM 于 1911 年由三家公司合并而成，其中最重要的是赫尔曼・霍勒里斯 1896 年创立的制表机公司。1941 年，IBM 的营收为 6000 万美元。</p><p>惠普 1964 年的营收为 1.25 亿美元。</p><p>微软 1988 年的营收为 5.9 亿美元。</p><p>注：本文的机翻水平简直垃圾的一塌糊涂，但是企鹅君不打算校正。因为任何愿意看这篇文章的人都应该去看原文也应该要能读懂原文——如果读不懂那就跳过这篇吧。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Putting-Ideas-into-Words"><a href="#Putting-Ideas-into-Words" class="headerlink" title="Putting Ideas into Words"></a>Putting Ideas into Words</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/words.html">https://paulgraham.com/words.html</a></p><p>February 2022</p><p>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn’t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won’t just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that’s why I write them.</p><p>写下某件事，即便你对它了如指掌，往往也会让你发现，你对它的了解其实没自己以为的那么深。将想法转化为文字是一场严苛的考验。你最初选择的措辞通常是错的，必须一遍遍地改写句子，才能让它们精准到位。而且，你的想法不仅会模糊不清，还会残缺不全。最终出现在文章里的想法，有一半是在写作过程中才冒出来的。事实上，这正是我写作的原因。</p><p>Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you’ve expressed them. But you know this isn’t true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.</p><p>一旦发表了某篇东西，惯例会让人觉得，你写下的内容就是动笔前就想好的 —— 这些是你的想法，现在只是把它们表达出来而已。但你自己清楚并非如此。你知道，将想法转化为文字的过程改变了它们。而且不止是那些被发表的想法，想必还有些想法因为漏洞太多、无法修正而被你舍弃了。</p><p>It’s not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you’ve written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what’s in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he’s not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn’t qualify some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.</p><p>写作之所以如此费心，不光是因为必须把想法落实到具体的文字上。真正的考验在于阅读自己写的东西。你得假装自己是个中立的读者，对你脑子里的想法一无所知，只看你写出来的文字。当 “他” 读你写的内容时，会觉得它正确吗？完整吗？只要肯努力，你就能像一个完全陌生的人那样读自己的作品 —— 而结果往往不尽如人意。我通常要改很多遍，才能让一篇文章通过 “陌生人” 的检验。但这个 “陌生人” 是理性的，只要你问他需要什么，总能让他满意。如果他因为你没提到 x，或者某个句子不够严谨而不满，那你就补上 x，再加些限定。这下满意了吗？这可能会让你删掉一些漂亮的句子，但你得接受这一点。你只能在满足 “陌生人” 的前提下，尽可能把句子写好。</p><p>This much, I assume, won’t be that controversial. I think it will accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I’ve never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned further, taps his head and says “It’s all up here.” Everyone watching the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and incomplete. Very likely there’s some undiscovered flaw that invalidates it completely. At best it’s a plan for a plan.</p><p>我觉得这点没什么争议，任何尝试过写点有分量的东西的人，应该都有过类似的体验。或许存在这样的人：他们的想法完美成型，能直接流畅地转化为文字。但我从没见过这样的人，要是有人说自己能做到，在我看来，这更能说明他们的局限，而非能力。电影里常有这样的桥段：一个人声称有个计划能完成某件难事，别人追问细节时，他拍着脑袋说 “都在这儿呢”。每个看电影的人都明白这意味着什么：往好里说，这个计划模糊又残缺；往坏里说，很可能存在某个未被发现的漏洞，让整个计划彻底失效。往最好了说，这只是个 “计划的计划”。</p><p>In precisely defined domains it’s possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don’t seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language. [1] Arguably what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some extent write essays in my head. I’ll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really I’m writing when I do this. I’m doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren’t moving as I do it. [2]</p><p>在定义精确的领域里，人或许能在脑子里形成完整的想法。比如，有人能在脑子里下象棋；数学家也能在脑子里做些数学演算，但超过一定长度的证明，他们似乎只有写下来才会觉得踏实。但这种情况似乎只限于能用形式语言表达的想法。[1] 可以说，这些人其实是在脑子里把想法转化为文字。我在某种程度上也能在脑子里 “写” 文章 —— 有时走路或躺在床上时想到的段落，在最终版本里几乎没什么改动。但其实，我这么做的时候就是在写作，只是进行的是写作的脑力活动，手指没动而已。[2]</p><p>You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn’t learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don’t think so. I’ve written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them. In both cases there were things I didn’t consciously realize till I had to explain them. And I don’t think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.</p><p>不写下来，你也能对某件事了解很多。但你能了解到那种程度吗 —— 以至于试着解释自己所知时，不会再有新发现？我觉得不能。我写过至少两个自己很熟悉的话题：Lisp 编程和创业，而两次写作都让我有了很多新认识。很多东西都是在不得不解释的时候，我才下意识地意识到。我觉得我的经历并非个例。很多知识是无意识的，而且专家的无意识知识占比或许比新手还高。</p><p>I’m not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I’m saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you’ll still learn new things from writing about them.</p><p>我不是说写作是探索所有想法的最佳方式。比如，如果你有关于建筑的想法，最佳探索方式或许是去盖实际的房子。我想说的是，无论你通过其他方式探索想法时学到了多少，写下来时仍会有新发现。</p><p>Putting ideas into words doesn’t have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don’t have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I’ll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you’re lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill. [3]</p><p>当然，将想法转化为文字不一定非得是写作，也可以用古老的方式 —— 交谈。但以我的经验，写作是更严苛的考验。你必须选定一个单一、最优的文字序列；没有语气辅助传达意思时，没说出口的东西就更站不住脚；而且你能专注到在交谈中显得过分的程度。我常常花两周写一篇文章，重读草稿 50 遍。要是在交谈中这么做，大概会被当成精神有问题。当然，如果你偷懒，写作和交谈都一样没用。但如果你想逼自己把事情弄对，写作就是更难爬的坡。[3]</p><p>The reason I’ve spent so long establishing this rather obvious point is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn’t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.</p><p>我花这么多篇幅讲这个看似显而易见的点，是因为它能引出一个很多人会觉得震惊的结论：如果写下想法总能让它们更精确、更完整，那么，没写过某个话题的人，对这个话题就不会有完全成型的想法；而从不写作的人，对任何有分量的事情都不会有完全成型的想法。</p><p>It feels to them as if they do, especially if they’re not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It’s only when you try to put them into words that you discover they’re not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you’ll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.</p><p>对这些人来说，他们似乎觉得自己有 —— 尤其是如果他们不习惯批判性审视自己的思考的话。想法可能会给人一种 “完整” 的感觉，但只有当你试着把它们转化为文字时，才会发现并非如此。所以，如果你从不拿这个标准检验自己的想法，不仅永远不会有完全成型的想法，还永远意识不到这一点。</p><p>Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they’ll be right. Far from it. But though it’s not a sufficient condition, it is a necessary one.</p><p>将想法转化为文字当然不能保证它们是对的 —— 远非如此。但尽管这不是充分条件，却是必要条件。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Machinery and circuits are formal languages.</p><p>[1] 机械和电路也是形式语言。</p><p>[2] I thought of this sentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.</p><p>[2] 这句话是我在帕洛阿尔托的街上走路时想到的。</p><p>[3] There are two senses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation is verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form, including writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca’s letters), conversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.</p><p>[3] “和人交谈” 有两种含义：狭义上指口头对话；广义上可以是任何形式，包括写作。在极端情况下（比如塞涅卡的书信），广义的交谈就成了散文写作。</p><p>It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people as you’re writing something. But a verbal conversation will never be more exacting than when you’re talking about something you’re writing.</p><p>写作时和别人交谈（无论哪种意义上的）可能非常有用，但口头对话的严苛程度，永远比不上谈论自己正在写的东西时。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Best-Essay"><a href="#The-Best-Essay" class="headerlink" title="The Best Essay"></a>The Best Essay</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/best.html">https://paulgraham.com/best.html</a></p><p>March 2024</p><p>Despite its title this isn’t meant to be the best essay. My goal here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.</p><p>尽管标题如此，这篇文章并非要成为 “最佳散文”。我的目标是弄清楚，最佳散文应该是什么样子的。</p><p>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic. What made it special would be what it was about.</p><p>它的文笔一定很好，但文笔好的文章可以写任何主题。让它脱颖而出的，是它所写的内容。</p><p>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably wouldn’t be about this year’s lipstick colors. But it wouldn’t be vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be surprising. It has to tell people something they don’t already know.</p><p>显然，有些主题本身就更有价值。它大概不会写今年的口红流行色，但也不会是对 “崇高主题” 的空洞空谈。一篇好散文必须令人惊喜，必须告诉人们一些他们不知道的事。</p><p>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell people something surprising about.</p><p>最佳散文的主题，应该是 “最重要且能带给人惊喜” 的 —— 既重要，又能说出些新鲜东西。</p><p>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences. One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of natural selection in an essay written in 1844. Talk about an important topic you could tell people something surprising about. If that’s the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one written in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any given time would usually be one describing the most important scientific or technological discovery it was possible to make. [1]</p><p>这听起来似乎显而易见，但细想之下会得出一些意外结论。其一，科学会像一头大象闯进划艇般闯入视野。比如，达尔文 1844 年写的一篇散文首次阐述了自然选择的概念。想想看，“重要且能带来惊喜”，若以此为标准，那篇文章无疑是 1844 年最好的散文。事实上，在任何时代，最佳散文通常都在描述当时最重大的科学或技术发现。[1]</p><p>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true. It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this sense. But it wouldn’t be impressive to write an essay introducing natural selection now. The best essay now would be one describing a great discovery we didn’t yet know about.</p><p>另一个意外结论是：我一开始以为，最佳散文应该是相当 “永恒” 的 ——1844 年的最佳散文和现在的最佳散文应该差不多。但事实似乎恰恰相反。最佳画作或许确实能如此 “永恒”，但现在再写一篇介绍自然选择的散文，就没什么冲击力了。如今的最佳散文，应该是描述一个我们尚未知晓的重大发现。</p><p>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we shouldn’t waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making discoveries in some specific domain. But I’m interested in essays and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there’s some other question I could have asked.</p><p>如果 “如何写出最佳散文” 的问题，最终归结为 “如何做出重大发现”，那我一开始就问错了问题。或许这个思考告诉我们：不该浪费时间写散文，而该专注于在某个特定领域做出发现。但我对散文及其可能性很感兴趣，所以想看看有没有其他值得问的问题。</p><p>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the one I started with. Instead of asking what would the best essay be? I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer to the first question, as we’ve seen, isn’t really about essay writing. The second question forces it to be.</p><p>还真有一个，表面上看它和我最初的问题几乎一样。与其问 “最佳散文是什么样的”，不如问 “如何写好散文”。这两个问题看似只是措辞不同，答案却大相径庭。如前所述，第一个问题的答案其实与 “写散文” 本身无关；而第二个问题，才迫使我们聚焦于写作本身。</p><p>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do you do that well? How do you discover by writing?</p><p>写散文的精髓，是一种发现思想的方式。如何做好这件事？如何通过写作发现思想？</p><p>An essay should ordinarily start with what I’m going to call a question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn’t have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like one in the sense that it spurs some response.</p><p>一篇散文通常始于一个我称之为 “问题” 的东西 —— 但我对 “问题” 的定义很宽泛：它不一定是语法意义上的问句，只要能引发某种回应，起到类似问题的作用就行。</p><p>How do you get this initial question? It probably won’t work to choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it. Professional traders won’t even trade unless they have what they call an edge — a convincing story about why in some class of trades they’ll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn’t attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about it or way of approaching it.</p><p>如何找到这个初始问题？随便选一个听起来重要的主题就动笔，大概是行不通的。专业交易者不会轻易出手，除非他们有 “优势”—— 一个能解释 “为什么在某类交易中赢多输少” 的合理逻辑。同理，写一个主题前，你得有 “切入点”：对它有新的洞见，或有新的探讨角度。</p><p>You don’t need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about something other people take for granted can be edge enough.</p><p>你不需要有完整的论点，只需有一个可供探索的 “缺口”。事实上，对别人习以为常的事抱有疑问，本身就可能是一种优势。</p><p>If you come across a question that’s sufficiently puzzling, it could be worth exploring even if it doesn’t seem very momentous. Many an important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed insignificant at first. How can they all be finches? [2]</p><p>如果遇到一个足够令人困惑的问题，即便它看似不重大，也值得探索。许多重要发现都始于一根看似无关紧要的 “线头”。比如，“它们怎么可能全是雀类？”[2]</p><p>Once you’ve got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts your ideas from vague to bad. But that’s a step forward, because once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.</p><p>有了问题之后呢？你开始 “大声” 思考它 —— 不是真的出声，而是像说话一样，用一串具体的文字回应它。这个初始回应通常是错误或不完整的。写作能把模糊的想法变成 “糟糕的具体文字”，但这是进步的一步：一旦看到漏洞，就能修补它。</p><p>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn’t be, because this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it’s wrong, you’ll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay writing is rereading what you’ve written and asking is this correct and complete? You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered.</p><p>或许初学写作的人会害怕从错误或不完整的内容开始，但不必如此 —— 这正是散文写作的意义所在。强迫自己写下具体的文字，就能获得一个起点；如果它错了，重读时你会发现。散文写作至少有一半的工作是重读已写内容，问自己 “这准确吗？完整吗？” 重读时必须严格，不仅是为了诚实，更因为 “你的回应与真相的差距” 往往藏着新的思想。</p><p>The prize for being strict with what you’ve written is not just refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can’t, and that the reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different. [3]</p><p>对文字严格要求的回报不止是精进。当你试图把一个大致正确的答案打磨得完全正确时，有时会发现做不到 —— 因为你依赖了一个错误的假设。抛弃这个假设后，答案可能会完全不同。[3]</p><p>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process continues recursively, as response spurs response. [4]</p><p>理想情况下，对问题的回应要满足两点：既是逐步接近真相的第一步，又是新问题（按我宽泛的定义）的来源。于是这个过程会递归进行，一个回应引发另一个回应。[4]</p><p>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which means you’re traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point. How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don’t consciously rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting; but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. [5]</p><p>一个问题通常有多种可能的回应，这意味着你在遍历一棵 “思想树”。但散文是线性的，不是树状的，所以每个节点你都得选一个分支走。怎么选？通常该选 “普遍性” 和 “新奇性” 结合得最好的那个。我不会刻意给分支排序，只是跟着最 “令人兴奋” 的那个走 —— 而普遍性和新奇性正是让分支令人兴奋的原因。[5]</p><p>If you’re willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don’t have to guess right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it isn’t good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time. In this essay I’ve already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition to countless shorter ones. Maybe I’ll reattach it at the end, or boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we’ll see. [6]</p><p>如果愿意多修改，一开始选错也没关系。你可以沿着一个分支走，看看结果如何；如果不够好，就删掉它，退回重选。我经常这么做。写这篇散文时，我已经删掉了一个 17 段的子分支，还有无数更短的段落。或许之后会把其中 5 段接回来，或精简成脚注，或扩展成另一篇散文 —— 再说吧。[6]</p><p>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep something that isn’t right, just because it contains a few good bits or cost you a lot of effort.</p><p>总的来说，要果断删减。写作（以及软件开发、绘画）中最危险的诱惑之一，是保留不合适的内容，只因为其中有几句好话，或花了很多功夫。</p><p>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is does it really matter what the initial question is? If the space of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn’t, because you should be able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few hops. And we see evidence that it’s highly connected in the way, for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where you want to go, and you don’t in an essay. That’s the whole point. You don’t want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your essays will be about the same thing. [7]</p><p>此刻浮现的最令人惊讶的新问题是：“初始问题真的重要吗？” 如果思想领域是高度关联的，那它就不重要 —— 因为从任何问题出发，几步之内都能抵达最有价值的问题。有证据支持这一点：比如，痴迷某个主题的人能把任何对话引向它。但这只在你知道目的地时才有用，而散文写作的关键是 “你不知道目的地”。你不想成为那个 “话题绑架者”，否则所有散文都会千篇一律。[7]</p><p>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don’t think about this when I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality. Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I’ve wandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is the optimal solution. You don’t want the hunt for novelty and generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what you get. [8]</p><p>初始问题重要的另一个原因是，你通常会觉得有点 “义务” 要围绕它写。选分支时我不会想这个，只是跟着新奇性和普遍性走。但后来发现偏离太远时，就得退回 —— 这其实是最优解。不必在当下限制对新奇性和普遍性的追求，先跟着走，看看会得到什么。[8]</p><p>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you’ll write. If you do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only place where there’s room for variation.</p><p>既然初始问题会限制你，那么在理想情况下，它决定了散文质量的上限。如果从初始问题延伸出的思路都做到了极致，那么初始问题本身就是唯一能产生差异的地方。</p><p>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though, because you can’t predict where a question will lead. Not if you’re doing things right, because doing things right means making discoveries, and by definition you can’t predict those. So the way to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays are for taking risks.</p><p>但也不该因此变得太保守，因为你无法预测一个问题会引向何方。如果写作得当，就必然会有发现 —— 而发现的定义就是 “不可预测”。所以面对这种情况，不该谨慎选择初始问题，而该多写散文。散文就是用来冒险的。</p><p>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third paragraph, because any essayist’s first impulse on hearing that the best essay couldn’t be about x would be to try to write it. But if most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.</p><p>几乎任何问题都能写出好散文。事实上，我在第三段费了点劲才想到一个 “没前途” 的主题 —— 因为任何散文家听到 “最佳散文不能写 x” 时，第一反应都是想试试写 x。但如果说大多数问题能写出好散文，那只有少数能写出伟大的散文。</p><p>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering how long I’ve been writing essays, it’s alarming how novel that question feels.</p><p>我们能预测哪些问题能写出伟大的散文吗？考虑到我写散文这么久了，这个问题竟让我觉得如此新奇，实在令人不安。</p><p>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three. This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive, though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay being better than another. And thinking about how to do something so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.</p><p>我喜欢的初始问题要有 “出格感”。我热爱那些看似 “无礼” 的问题 —— 比如反直觉、野心过大，或离经叛道，最好三者兼具。这篇散文就是个例子。写 “最佳散文” 意味着默认存在 “最佳”，伪知识分子会斥之为 “简化”，但既然散文有优劣之分，“最佳” 就必然存在。思考如何完成如此宏大的事，本身就接近 “做这件事”，足以抓住注意力。</p><p>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just a taste of mine, but there’s one aspect of it that probably isn’t: to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch for the novel insights that are the raison d’etre of the essay, you have to care.</p><p>我喜欢带着 “一丝狡黠” 开始写散文。这可能只是我的个人偏好，但有一点大概不是：要写一篇关于某个主题的好散文，你必须对它感兴趣。好作家能写好任何主题，但要挖掘出散文的核心 —— 新奇的洞见，你必须在乎这个主题。</p><p>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question, then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also means you’re more likely to write great essays if you care about a lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the probable overlap between the set of things you’re curious about and the set of topics that yield great essays.</p><p>如果 “在乎” 是好的初始问题的标准之一，那么 “最优问题” 就因人而异。这也意味着，如果你对很多不同的事都感兴趣，就更可能写出伟大的散文。好奇心越强，你感兴趣的事与 “能写出伟大散文的主题” 的重合概率就越高。</p><p>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It’s probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas. And I find it’s a good sign if it’s one that people think has already been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I’ve barely thought about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I rarely choose what to write about; I just start thinking about something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.</p><p>伟大的初始问题还该有什么特质？它最好能在多个领域产生影响。我发现，如果一个问题被认为 “已被彻底探索过”，反而是个好迹象。但说实话，我几乎没思考过如何选择初始问题 —— 因为我很少主动选。我很少决定 “要写什么”，只是开始思考某件事，有时它就变成了一篇散文。</p><p>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be thinking about and instead start working my way through some systematically generated list of topics? That doesn’t sound like much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial question matters, I should care about it.</p><p>我会停止写 “碰巧想到的事”，转而按某个系统生成的主题列表来写吗？这听起来没什么意思。但我想写好散文，如果初始问题重要，我就该在乎它。</p><p>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn’t be any use if you didn’t have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can’t generate those systematically. If only. [9]</p><p>或许答案是再往前一步：写任何冒出来的想法，但努力让冒出来的想法是好的。其实仔细想想，这必然是答案 —— 因为如果对列表上的主题没有 “切入点”，列表就毫无用处。写散文需要 “主题 + 初始洞见”，而这两者无法系统生成。要是能生成就好了。[9]</p><p>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.</p><p>但你或许能让自己产生更多这样的想法。脑子里冒出的想法质量，取决于输入的内容，而你可以从两个维度提升输入：广度和深度。</p><p>You can’t learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps that’s actually optimal in this business.</p><p>你不可能什么都学，所以 “广度” 意味着学差异很大的主题。我跟人说我去海伊镇买书的经历，他们问我买什么主题的书时，我总有点不好意思 —— 那些主题像一堆不相关的杂物。但或许在写作这行，这恰恰是最优解。</p><p>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building things, and by going places and seeing things. I don’t think it’s important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart people. I know because that’s what a block of office hours at Y Combinator consists of.</p><p>你也能通过与人交谈、做事、造东西、去不同地方看不同事物获得想法。我觉得重要的不是 “和新朋友聊”，而是 “和能让你产生新想法的人聊”。和罗伯特・莫里斯聊一下午，比和 20 个聪明的新朋友聊，能给我更多新想法。我知道这一点，因为 Y Combinator 的办公时间就是这样。</p><p>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing, I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was hard.</p><p>广度来自阅读、交谈和观察，深度则来自实践。真正了解一个领域的方式，是必须在其中解决问题。虽然写作本身也能算一种实践，但我怀疑，要成为好的散文家，还得做（或做过）其他类型的工作。这对其他领域可能不适用，但散文写作不同。你可以花一半时间做别的事，只要那件事有难度，最终反而可能更擅长写作。</p><p>I’m not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to those already doing it. If you’ve spent all your life so far working on other things, you’re already halfway there. Though of course to be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing you’d probably have spent at least some time doing it.</p><p>我不是在提供一个 “配方”，更像是在鼓励已经这么做的人。如果你这辈子大部分时间都在做其他事，其实已经成功了一半。当然，要擅长写作，你得喜欢写作；如果喜欢，你大概至少花过一些时间写。</p><p>Everything I’ve said about initial questions applies also to the questions you encounter in writing the essay. They’re the same thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good whole essays.</p><p>关于初始问题的所有说法，也适用于写作中遇到的其他问题。它们本质上是一回事：散文的每个子分支通常都是一篇更短的散文，就像考尔德的动态雕塑，每个子结构都是一个更小的雕塑。所以，能让你得到好的初始问题的技巧，也能让你写出好的完整散文。</p><p>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn’t every answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you start to feel sated. Once you’ve covered enough interesting ground, you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it’s not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be asking the initial question of a new essay.</p><p>某个时刻，“提问 - 回应” 的循环会抵达一个 “自然终点”。这有点可疑 —— 难道每个答案不该引出更多问题吗？我想，原因是你开始 “满足” 了。探索了足够多有趣的领域后，对新问题的 “胃口” 会下降。这也无妨，因为读者可能也觉得满足了。停止提问不是懒惰，因为你可以转而开始一篇新散文的初始问题。</p><p>That’s the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas: the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough starting from question A, you’ll never make it to question B. Though if you keep writing essays you’ll gradually fix this problem by burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.</p><p>思想关联性的最终 “阻力” 来自途中的发现：如果从问题 A 出发发现了足够多东西，你可能永远不会抵达问题 B。但如果持续写散文，你会逐渐 “消耗” 这些发现，从而解决这个问题。所以说来也怪，多写散文会让思想领域显得 “更关联”。</p><p>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that the best possible essay wouldn’t usually be timeless in the way the best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be worth investigating further.</p><p>当一个子分支结束时，你有两个选择：要么停笔，要么玩个 “立体主义把戏”—— 回到之前跳过的问题，把不同子分支串起来。通常这需要些 “手法” 让散文流畅衔接，但这次不用。这次我正好需要一个例子：比如我们之前发现，最佳散文通常不会像最佳画作那样 “永恒”。这一点足够令人惊讶，值得深入探讨。</p><p>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us. But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays teach, and you can’t teach people something they already know. Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance, but an essay explaining it couldn’t have the same effect on us that it would have had on Darwin’s contemporaries, precisely because his ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them. [10]</p><p>散文的 “永恒” 有两种含义：写的是永久重要的事；对读者的影响永远不变。艺术中这两种含义是融合的 —— 古希腊人觉得美的雕塑，我们现在也觉得美。但散文不同，因为散文是 “教” 人的，你没法教别人已经知道的事。自然选择无疑是永久重要的，但解释它的散文对我们的影响，不可能和对达尔文同时代人的影响一样 —— 恰恰因为他的思想太成功，现在每个人都知道了。[10]</p><p>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn’t seem to be true. But if the best possible essay wouldn’t usually be timeless in this stricter sense, what would it take to write essays that were?</p><p>我一开始以为，最佳散文应该是 “严格永恒” 的 —— 包含深刻、永恒的智慧，能同时打动亚里士多德和费曼。但事实似乎并非如此。如果最佳散文通常不会是这种 “严格永恒” 的，那要写出 “永恒的散文” 该怎么做？</p><p>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that its discoveries aren’t assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers. If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as well, you have to write essays that won’t stick — essays that, no matter how good they are, won’t become part of what people in the future learn before they read them. [11]</p><p>答案很奇怪：要成为 “常青” 的永恒散文，它必须是 “无效” 的 —— 它的发现没有被融入我们的共同文化。否则，第二代读者就不会从中看到新东西。如果你想不仅现在能让读者惊讶，未来也能，就得写 “留不下痕迹” 的散文 —— 无论多好，都不会成为未来读者在阅读前就已了解的内容。[11]</p><p>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about things people never learn. For example, it’s a long-established pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes, and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them weren’t worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised by it.</p><p>我能想到几种实现方式。一种是写人们永远学不会的事。比如，有个长久存在的模式：有野心的人追逐各种 “奖励”，后来（或许太晚）才发现其中一些不值那么多。写这个主题，你可以确定未来会有源源不断的读者被它惊讶到。</p><p>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions, for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless topic.</p><p>同理，写 “缺乏经验的人容易过度做事”—— 比如年轻工程师搞出过于复杂的解决方案。有些错误，人们只有亲身犯过才会避免。这类主题都能是永恒的。</p><p>Sometimes when we’re slow to grasp things it’s not just because we’re obtuse or in denial but because we’ve been deliberately lied to. There are a lot of things adults lie to kids about, and when you reach adulthood, they don’t take you aside and hand you a list of them. They don’t remember which lies they told you, and most were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.</p><p>有时我们迟迟无法理解某事，不仅因为迟钝或否认，还因为被故意欺骗。成年人对孩子撒了很多谎，等孩子成年后，他们不会拉你到一边，给你列一张 “谎言清单”。他们不记得撒过哪些谎，而且大多数谎言是暗示性的。所以，只要成年人还在撒谎，反驳这些谎言就会一直是惊喜的来源。</p><p>Sometimes it’s systems that lie to you. For example, the educational systems in most countries train you to win by hacking the test. But that’s not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will work as long as the institutions remain broken. [12]</p><p>有时是 “系统” 在撒谎。比如，大多数国家的教育系统训练你 “钻考试空子” 取胜。但这不是在最重要的现实考验中取胜的方式，而经过几十年的训练，刚进入现实世界的人很难明白这一点。只要这些系统还在崩坏，帮助人们识破这种 “体制性谎言” 就会一直有效。[12]</p><p>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted culturally. “Everyone knows,” for example, that it can be rewarding to have kids. But till you have them you don’t know precisely what forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never have put into words.</p><p>另一种 “永恒配方” 是写读者已经知道的事，但细节丰富到无法被文化传播。比如，“大家都知道” 养孩子能带来回报，但没养过的人不知道具体是什么形式；就算养过，很多感受也难以用语言表达。</p><p>I’ve written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn’t do it in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one’s ideas not sticking suggests that it’s not worth making a deliberate attempt to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the better. You’ve crossed into Darwin territory.</p><p>这些主题我都写过，但并非刻意为了写出 “严格永恒” 的散文。事实上，“永恒” 依赖于 “思想留不下痕迹”，这意味着刻意追求它没什么意义。你当然要写永恒重要的主题，但如果写得太好，结论被广泛接受，未来读者觉得你的散文 “显而易见” 而非 “新奇”，那更好 —— 你已经进入了达尔文的领域。</p><p>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate aim.</p><p>写永恒重要的主题，其实是更普遍原则的一个例子：适用性的广度。除了时间上的广度，还有其他类型的广度 —— 比如适用于多个领域。所以，“广度” 才是最终目标。</p><p>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I’m always chasing. But I’m glad I understand where timelessness fits.</p><p>我一直追求广度和新奇性。但现在明白了 “永恒” 的位置，我很高兴。</p><p>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would be nice. But when you step back and ask what’s the best you can do short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting with the answers.</p><p>现在我更明白很多事的位置了。这篇散文算是一次 “散文写作漫游”。我一开始想得到关于 “主题” 的建议：如果假设文笔好，那么区分最佳散文的就只有主题。我确实得到了建议：去发现自然选择。嗯，这当然好。但退一步想，在做出那样的重大发现之前，能做到的最佳状态是什么？答案是 “过程”。最终，散文的质量取决于其中发现的思想，而获取思想的方式是：广泛捕捉问题，然后对答案极其苛刻。</p><p>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence. You don’t have to get an answer right the first time, but there’s no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility. It’s a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I’m rewriting as we speak.</p><p>这张 “散文写作地图” 最显著的特征，是 “灵感” 与 “努力” 交替出现的条纹。问题依赖灵感，但答案可以靠坚持获得。你不必一次就答对，但最终必须答对 —— 因为可以不断修改，直到正确。这不是理论上的可能，而是我工作方式的准确描述。我此刻就在修改。</p><p>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly on effort, in the limit case it’s inspiration that makes the difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing to get. That pool has no bottom.</p><p>但尽管我想说 “写伟大的散文主要靠努力”，但在极限情况下，差异由灵感决定。极限情况下，问题更难获得。这是个无底洞。</p><p>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of all.</p><p>如何获得更多问题？这才是最重要的问题。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos, could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.</p><p>[1] 有人可能反对这个结论，理由是有些发现只有少数读者能理解。但以此为由否定一篇散文，会陷入各种困境。如何决定 “少数” 的界限？如果病毒杀死了所有人，只剩洛斯阿拉莫斯实验室的几个人，那之前被否定的散文现在是否合格？等等。</p><p>Darwin’s 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839. Extracts from it were published in 1858.</p><p>达尔文 1844 年的散文改编自 1839 年的早期版本，节选于 1858 年发表。</p><p>[2] When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor question, that’s an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to pay attention to things that matter. So when you’re very curious about something random, that could mean you’ve unconsciously noticed it’s less random than it seems.</p><p>[2] 当你对一个看似次要的问题充满好奇时，这是个令人兴奋的信号。进化让我们关注 “重要的事”，所以当你对某个随机的事充满好奇，可能是潜意识里发现它没那么随机。</p><p>[3] Corollary: If you’re not intellectually honest, your writing won’t just be biased, but also boring, because you’ll miss all the ideas you’d have discovered if you pushed for the truth.</p><p>[3] 推论：如果不够理智诚实，你的写作不仅会有偏见，还会无聊 —— 因为你会错过所有 “追求真相时本可以发现” 的思想。</p><p>[4] Sometimes this process begins before you start writing. Sometimes you’ve already figured out the first few things you want to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide everything they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they start writing the essay itself. Maybe that’s a good way to get them started — or not, I don’t know — but it’s antithetical to the spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.</p><p>[4] 这个过程有时在动笔前就开始了。有时你已经想好了开头要说的几件事。学生常被教导：应该先确定所有想写的内容，列成提纲，再开始写散文。或许这是教他们入门的好方法（也可能不是，我不知道），但与散文写作的精神相悖。提纲越详细，思想就越难从散文特有的 “发现” 中获益。</p><p>[5] The problem with this type of “greedy” algorithm is that you can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is preceded by a boring one, you’ll overlook it. But I can’t imagine a better strategy. There’s no lookahead except by writing. So use a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.</p><p>[5] 这种 “贪心算法” 的问题是可能陷入 “局部最优”。如果最有价值的问题前有一个无聊的问题，你就会错过它。但我想不出更好的策略。除了写作，没有 “预知” 的方法。所以，用贪心算法，多花时间。</p><p>[6] I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and discarding the rest.</p><p>[6] 最后我把 17 段中的前 5 段接了回来，其余删掉了。</p><p>[7] Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.</p><p>[7] 史蒂芬・弗莱承认，在牛津考试时用过这种方法。他脑子里有一篇关于某个通用文学主题的标准散文，会想办法把考题引向它，然后复述出来。</p><p>Strictly speaking it’s the graph of ideas that would be highly connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who don’t know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get what I mean if I say “space”.</p><p>严格来说，“高度关联” 的是 “思想图谱”，而非 “领域”，但用 “领域” 不会让不懂图论的人困惑，而懂的人会明白我的意思。</p><p>[8] Too far doesn’t depend just on the distance from the original topic. It’s more like that distance divided by the value of whatever I’ve discovered in the subtree.</p><p>[8] “偏离太远” 不仅取决于与原主题的距离，更像 “距离除以子分支中发现的价值”。</p><p>[9] Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.</p><p>[9] 或许可以？我应该写写这个。就算成功概率低，预期价值也很大。</p><p>[10] There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair, art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks’ naturalistic sculptures represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.</p><p>[10] 20 世纪有种潮流，说艺术的目的也是 “教”。有些艺术家为作品辩护时说，目标不是创造好东西，而是挑战我们对艺术的偏见。公平地说，艺术确实能教一点。古希腊的写实雕塑代表了新思想，对同时代人来说一定格外令人兴奋。但它们现在看起来依然好。</p><p>[11] Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th century with his ideas about “trial marriage.” But they make boring reading now, because they prevailed. “Trial marriage” is what we call “dating.”</p><p>[11] 伯特兰・罗素 20 世纪初关于 “试婚” 的想法引发巨大争议，但现在读起来很无聊 —— 因为他的想法赢了。“试婚” 就是我们说的 “约会”。</p><p>[12] If you’d asked me 10 years ago, I’d have predicted that schools would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible micro-assessments.</p><p>[12] 10 年前如果问我，我会预测学校会继续教 “钻考试空子” 几个世纪。但现在看来，学生可能很快会由 AI 一对一教学，考试会被持续、隐形的 “微评估” 取代。</p>]]></content>

    <title>淡化你的身份标识</title>
    <link href="/2025/07/31/keep-your-identity-small/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Keep-Your-Identity-Small"><a href="#Keep-Your-Identity-Small" class="headerlink" title="Keep Your Identity Small"></a>Keep Your Identity Small</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/identity.html">https://paulgraham.com/identity.html</a></p><p>February 2009</p><p>I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such uniquely useless discussions.</p><p>今天我终于意识到，为何政治和宗教总会引发毫无意义的讨论。</p><p>As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument. Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?</p><p>通常来说，在网络论坛上只要提到宗教，讨论就会演变成宗教争论。为什么会这样？为什么宗教话题会如此，而 JavaScript、烘焙或其他人们在论坛上讨论的话题却不会？</p><p>What’s different about religion is that people don’t feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone’s an expert.</p><p>宗教的特别之处在于，人们觉得自己无需具备任何专业知识，就能对其发表见解。他们所需要的只是强烈的信念，而任何人都能拥有这种信念。关于 JavaScript 的帖子不会像宗教话题的帖子那样迅速发酵，因为人们会觉得，要对 JavaScript 发表评论，自己的专业水平必须达到一定门槛。但在宗教话题上，每个人都自认为是专家。</p><p>Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there’s no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions.</p><p>随后我突然想到：政治也是同样的问题。和宗教一样，在政治话题中，发表观点无需任何专业门槛，只要有强烈的信念就行。</p><p>Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there’s no back pressure on people’s opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs.</p><p>宗教和政治是否存在某种共性，能解释这种相似性？一种可能的解释是，它们涉及的问题没有明确答案，因此人们的观点不会受到反驳的压力。既然没人能被证明是错的，那么每种观点都同样 “合理”，正因为意识到这一点，每个人都会肆意发表自己的看法。</p><p>But this isn’t true. There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy will cost. But the more precise political questions suffer the same fate as the vaguer ones.</p><p>但事实并非如此。某些政治问题显然有明确答案，比如一项新的政府政策会耗费多少资金。然而，越是精确的政治问题，最终的下场却和那些模糊的问题一样（引发无意义争论）。</p><p>I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people’s identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that’s part of their identity. By definition they’re partisan.</p><p>我认为，宗教和政治的共同点在于，它们会成为人们身份标识的一部分，而人们永远无法就属于自己身份标识的事物进行富有成效的争论。按理说，他们必然会带有偏见。</p><p>Which topics engage people’s identity depends on the people, not the topic. For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn’t. No one would know what side to be on. So it’s not politics that’s the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people’s identities. [1]</p><p>哪些话题会涉及人们的身份标识，取决于人本身，而非话题本身。例如，若一场关于战争的讨论涉及某个或多个参战国的公民，那它很可能会演变成政治争论。但如今讨论一场发生在青铜时代的战争，或许就不会如此 —— 因为没人知道该站在哪一方。所以，问题的根源并非政治，而是身份标识。当人们说一场讨论演变成了 “宗教战争”，他们真正想表达的是，这场讨论已开始主要由人们的身份标识所驱动。[1]</p><p>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it’s a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers identify as X programmers or Y programmers. This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all languages are equally good. Obviously that’s false: anything else people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages? And indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.</p><p>由于这种情况的发生取决于人而非话题，因此若得出 “某个问题容易引发‘宗教战争’，就说明它一定没有答案” 的结论，那就错了。比如，关于编程语言优劣的讨论，往往会演变成 “宗教战争”，因为太多程序员将自己定位为 “X 语言程序员” 或 “Y 语言程序员”。这有时会让人们认为，这个问题一定没有答案 —— 所有语言都一样好。但显然这是错误的：人们创造的其他任何事物都有设计优劣之分，编程语言为何会是特例？事实上，只要排除那些从身份标识出发进行回应的人，关于编程语言优劣的讨论就能富有成效。</p><p>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn’t engage the identities of any of the participants. What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people’s identities. But you could in principle have a useful conversation about them with some people. And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn’t safely talk about with others.</p><p>更广泛地说，只有当一个话题不涉及任何参与者的身份标识时，相关讨论才能富有成效。政治和宗教之所以像雷区，是因为它们涉及太多人的身份标识。但理论上，你可以和一些人就这些话题进行有益的交流。反之，有些看似无害的话题，比如福特和雪佛兰皮卡的优劣，你却可能无法和某些人安全地展开讨论。</p><p>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it’s right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas. If people can’t think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible. [2]</p><p>如果这个理论是正确的，那么最有趣的一点是，它不仅解释了应该避免哪些类型的讨论，还说明了如何产生更好的想法。如果人们无法清晰思考那些已成为自身身份标识一部分的事物，那么在其他条件相同的情况下，最好的办法就是让尽可能少的事物成为你的身份标识。[2]</p><p>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant. But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x. The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.</p><p>读到这篇文章的大多数人可能已经相当宽容了。但还有一个境界超越了 “认为自己是 x，但容忍 y”：那就是根本不把自己当作 x。你给自己贴的标签越多，就会变得越愚蠢。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going critical. The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which brings in more people. And they tend to say incendiary things, which draw more and angrier counterarguments.</p><p>[1] 这种情况发生时，往往会像核反应堆达到临界状态一样迅速。参与讨论的门槛降至零，这会吸引更多人加入。而且他们往往会说些煽动性的话，从而引发更多、更愤怒的反驳。</p><p>[2] There may be some things it’s a net win to include in your identity. For example, being a scientist. But arguably that is more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn’t commit you to believing anything in particular. A scientist isn’t committed to believing in natural selection in the same way a biblical literalist is committed to rejecting it. All he’s committed to is following the evidence wherever it leads.</p><p>[2] 或许有些事物成为身份标识总体而言是有益的，比如 “科学家” 这个身份。但可以说，这更多是一个占位符而非实际标签 —— 就像在要求填写中间名首字母的表格上填 “NMI”（无中间名）一样 —— 因为它并不要求你坚信某件具体的事。科学家不会像圣经直译主义者坚信要否定自然选择那样，坚信自然选择的正确性。他所坚守的，只是跟随证据的指引。</p><p>Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign in a cupboard saying “this cupboard must be kept empty.” Yes, strictly speaking, you’re putting something in the cupboard, but not in the ordinary sense.</p><p>把自己视为科学家，相当于在橱柜上贴一张标签，上面写着 “这个橱柜必须保持空的”。严格来说，你确实在橱柜上放了东西，但并非通常意义上的 “放东西”。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Top-Idea-in-Your-Mind"><a href="#The-Top-Idea-in-Your-Mind" class="headerlink" title="The Top Idea in Your Mind"></a>The Top Idea in Your Mind</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/top.html">https://paulgraham.com/top.html</a></p><p>July 2010</p><p>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the morning is more important than I’d thought. I knew it was a good time to have ideas. Now I’d go further: now I’d say it’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower.</p><p>我最近意识到，早上在洗澡时思考的事情，比我之前认为的要重要得多。我知道那是产生想法的好时机。现在我要更进一步说：如果你在洗澡时都不会去想某件事，那你很难把它做好。</p><p>Everyone who’s worked on difficult problems is probably familiar with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing, and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something else. There’s a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I’m increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you can only control it indirectly. [1]</p><p>每个钻研过难题的人可能都熟悉这种现象：拼命想弄明白一件事，却失败了，过一会儿在做别的事时，答案突然就浮现了。有一种思考是无需刻意为之的。我越来越相信，这种思考方式不仅对解决难题有帮助，而且是必需的。棘手的是，你只能间接控制它。[1]</p><p>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time. That’s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they’re allowed to drift freely. And this idea will thus tend to get all the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of it. Which means it’s a disaster to let the wrong idea become the top one in your mind.</p><p>我觉得大多数人在任何时候，心里都有一个首要念头。当思绪自由飘荡时，它们总会飘向这个念头。因此，这种思考方式带来的好处，往往都会集中在这个念头上，而其他想法则会被剥夺。这意味着，让错误的念头成为你心中的首要念头，是一场灾难。</p><p>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn’t want as the top one in my mind for two long stretches.</p><p>有两段很长的时间，我心中的首要念头是我不想要的，这让我深刻明白了这一点。</p><p>I’d noticed startups got way less done when they started raising money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood why. The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with investors. The problem is that once you start raising money, raising money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes what you think about when you take a shower in the morning. And that means other questions aren’t.</p><p>我注意到，创业公司在开始融资后，做事效率会大幅下降，但直到我们自己去融资时，我才明白原因。问题不在于和投资者见面所花费的实际时间，而在于一旦你开始融资，融资就会成为你心中的首要念头。这会变成你早上在洗澡时思考的事情，而这意味着其他问题就不会被你想起了。</p><p>I’d hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I’d forgotten why I hated it so much. When we raised money for Y Combinator, I remembered. Money matters are particularly likely to become the top idea in your mind. The reason is that they have to be. It’s hard to get money. It’s not the sort of thing that happens by default. It’s not going to happen unless you let it become the thing you think about in the shower. And then you’ll make little progress on anything else you’d rather be working on. [2]</p><p>我在经营 Viaweb 时就讨厌融资，但我忘了自己为什么这么讨厌。当我们为 Y Combinator 融资时，我想起来了。与钱相关的事情特别容易成为人们心中的首要念头，原因是它们必须如此。赚钱并不容易，它不是那种自然而然就会发生的事。除非你让它成为你在洗澡时思考的事情，否则它是不会发生的。但这样一来，你在其他你更想做的事情上，就很难取得进展了。[2]</p><p>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors. Professors nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a little research on the side. It may be time to fix that.)</p><p>（我从当教授的朋友那里听到了类似的抱怨。如今的教授似乎变成了专业的筹款人，只在业余时间做一点研究。或许是时候改变这种状况了。）</p><p>The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the preceding 10 years I’d been able to think about what I wanted. So the contrast when I couldn’t was sharp. But I don’t think this problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I’ve seen grinds to a halt when they start raising money — or talking to acquirers.</p><p>这件事给我带来如此强烈的冲击，是因为在之前的 10 年里，大多数时候我都能思考自己想思考的事情。所以当我不能再这样做时，反差非常鲜明。但我认为这个问题并非只发生在我身上，因为我看到几乎每一家创业公司，在开始融资或者与收购方谈判时，都会停滞不前。</p><p>You can’t directly control where your thoughts drift. If you’re controlling them, they’re not drifting. But you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into. That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let become critical to you. Try to get yourself into situations where the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.</p><p>你无法直接控制自己的思绪飘向何方。如果思绪在你的控制之下，那它们就不是在自由飘荡了。但你可以通过控制自己所处的环境，来间接控制思绪。这就是我从中得到的教训：要小心那些你让其变得至关重要的事情。努力让自己处于这样的境地：最紧急的问题是你自己想思考的。</p><p>You don’t have complete control, of course. An emergency could push other thoughts out of your head. But barring emergencies you have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea in your mind.</p><p>当然，你不可能完全掌控。突发情况可能会把其他想法从你脑海中挤出去。但在没有突发情况的情况下，你对心中的首要念头有很大的间接控制权。</p><p>I’ve found there are two types of thoughts especially worth avoiding — thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push out more interesting ideas. One I’ve already mentioned: thoughts about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention sink. The other is disputes. These too are engaging in the wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely interesting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work done. [3]</p><p>我发现有两种想法尤其值得避免 —— 它们就像尼罗河鲈鱼一样，会把更有趣的想法排挤出去。一种我已经提到过了：与钱有关的想法。按理说，赚钱几乎就是一个注意力黑洞。另一种是争论。争论也会以错误的方式占据你的注意力：它们和真正有趣的想法一样，都像有魔力似的吸引人，但却没有实质内容。所以，如果你想做真正的工作，就要避免争论。[3]</p><p>Even Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years, finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:</p><p>就连牛顿也掉进过这个陷阱。1672 年发表了他的色彩理论后，他发现自己多年来一直被争论所困扰，最后得出结论：唯一的解决办法就是停止发表作品：</p><p>I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free of Mr Linus’s business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally, excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come out after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or become a slave to defend it. [4]</p><p>“我发现自己成了哲学的奴隶，但如果我能摆脱莱纳斯先生的事，我会坚决永远告别哲学，除非是为了个人满足而做的事，或者留到我死后再发表。因为我明白，一个人要么决心不发表任何新东西，要么就会成为捍卫它的奴隶。”[4]</p><p>Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious critics. Newton’s biographer Westfall seems to feel he was overreacting:</p><p>列日的莱纳斯和他的学生是其中最固执的批评者。牛顿的传记作者韦斯特福尔似乎觉得他反应过度了：</p><p>Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton’s “slavery” consisted of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over the course of a year.</p><p>回想一下，在他写这封信的时候，牛顿的 “奴役” 不过是在一年的时间里，对列日的批评做出了五次回应，总共 14 页印刷内容。</p><p>I’m more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages, but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about other things.</p><p>我更能理解牛顿。问题不在于那 14 页文字，而在于这种愚蠢的争论不断地成为他脑海中的首要念头，而他其实迫切地想思考其他事情，这太痛苦了。</p><p>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages. Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the second half. I’ve found I can to some extent avoid thinking about nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn’t deserve space in my head. I’m always delighted to find I’ve forgotten the details of disputes, because that means I hadn’t been thinking about them. My wife thinks I’m more forgiving than she is, but my motives are purely selfish.</p><p>事实证明，宽容待人有其自私的好处。伤害你的人会伤害你两次：第一次是伤害本身，第二次是让你在事后花时间去想它。如果你学会忽略伤害，至少可以避免第二次伤害。我发现，通过告诉自己 “这不值得占据我的思绪”，我在某种程度上可以避免去想别人对我做的讨厌事。当我发现自己已经忘记了争论的细节时，我总是很高兴，因为这意味着我没有一直在想它们。我妻子认为我比她更宽容，但我的动机纯粹是自私的。</p><p>I suspect a lot of people aren’t sure what’s the top idea in their mind at any given time. I’m often mistaken about it. I tend to think it’s the idea I’d want to be the top one, rather than the one that is. But it’s easy to figure this out: just take a shower. What topic do your thoughts keep returning to? If it’s not what you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.</p><p>我怀疑很多人并不清楚在某个时刻自己心中的首要念头是什么。我自己也经常判断错误。我往往会认为那是我希望成为首要念头的想法，而不是实际的那个。但要弄清楚这一点很容易：只需洗个澡。你的思绪会不断回到哪个话题上？如果那不是你想思考的事情，你可能就需要做出一些改变了。</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but I call it “ambient thought.”</p><p>[1] 毫无疑问，这种思考方式可能已经有了名称，但我称之为 “环境式思考”。</p><p>[2] This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the process dragged on for months. Moving large amounts of money around is never something people treat casually. The attention required increases with the amount—maybe not linearly, but definitely monotonically.</p><p>[2] 这在我们的案例中表现得尤为明显，因为我们筹集的两笔资金都不算困难，但两次过程都拖了好几个月。大笔资金的流动，人们向来不会掉以轻心。所需的注意力会随着金额的增加而增加 —— 可能不是线性的，但肯定是单调递增的。</p><p>[3] Corollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will consist of dealing with money and disputes.</p><p>[3] 推论：避免成为管理者，否则你的工作就会充斥着与钱和争论相关的事情。</p><p>[4] Letter to Oldenburg, quoted in Westfall, Richard, Life of Isaac Newton, p. 107.</p><p>[4] 致奥登堡的信，引自理查德・韦斯特福尔《牛顿传》，第 107 页。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Why-Nerds-are-Unpopular"><a href="#Why-Nerds-are-Unpopular" class="headerlink" title="Why Nerds are Unpopular"></a>Why Nerds are Unpopular</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html">https://paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a></p><p>February 2003</p><p>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the kids with mild cases of Down’s Syndrome, what in the language of the time we called “retards.”</p><p>初中时，我和朋友里奇曾根据受欢迎程度给学校的午餐桌画了一张地图。这事儿不难，因为孩子们只和与自己受欢迎程度相近的人一起吃饭。我们把桌子从 A 到 E 分级：A 桌坐满了足球运动员、啦啦队员之类的人；E 桌则是那些患有轻度唐氏综合征的孩子，按当时的说法，我们叫他们 “傻子”。</p><p>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise. Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was, including us.</p><p>我们坐在 D 桌 —— 在外表和别人没差别的情况下，这已经是最低等级了。给自个儿评 D 并非过分坦诚，要说别的，那才是故意撒谎。全校每个人都清楚彼此的受欢迎程度，我们也不例外。</p><p>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived; I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground newspaper. So I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.</p><p>高中时，我的 “等级” 慢慢上升了：青春期终于到来，我成了还不错的足球选手，还办了一份引起轰动的地下报纸。所以，我对 “受欢迎” 这事儿的方方面面还算了解。</p><p>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular.</p><p>我认识很多上学时是书呆子的人，他们的经历如出一辙：聪明和书呆子气之间有很强的相关性，而书呆子气和受欢迎程度之间的负相关更强。似乎聪明就会让你不受欢迎。</p><p>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart doesn’t make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult. Why?</p><p>为什么？对现在还在上学的人来说，这问题可能有点奇怪。事实太明显了，以至于很难想象还有别的可能。但其实是有的：在小学，聪明不会让你成为异类；在现实世界，聪明也不会对你不利；而且据我所知，在其他大多数国家，这问题也没这么严重。但在典型的美国中学里，聪明很可能会让你的日子不好过。为什么？</p><p>The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why don’t smart kids make themselves popular? If they’re so smart, why don’t they figure out how popularity works and beat the system, just as they do for standardized tests?</p><p>解开这个谜团的关键，是把问题换个说法：为什么聪明的孩子不让自己变得受欢迎？既然他们这么聪明，为什么不像应对标准化考试那样，搞懂受欢迎的门道，然后 “玩转规则” 呢？</p><p>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart, and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that guys envy, girls like.</p><p>有一种说法是这不可能：聪明的孩子不受欢迎，是因为其他孩子嫉妒他们的聪明，所以无论他们做什么都没用。但愿如此吧。要是初中时其他孩子真嫉妒我，那他们可太会掩饰了。而且，要是聪明真的是值得羡慕的特质，女孩们早就该 “叛变” 了 —— 男孩们嫉妒的人，女孩们往往会喜欢。</p><p>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn’t matter much. Kids didn’t admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.</p><p>在我就读的学校里，聪明根本不算什么。孩子们既不崇拜，也不鄙视聪明。其他条件相同的话，他们或许更愿意做中等偏上的聪明人，而不是笨蛋，但智力的重要性远不及外貌、魅力或运动能力。</p><p>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that they don’t really want to be popular.</p><p>既然智力本身和受欢迎程度无关，那为什么聪明的孩子总是不受欢迎？我觉得答案是：他们其实并不想受欢迎。</p><p>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn’t want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of thirst in a desert that he didn’t want a glass of water. Of course I wanted to be popular.</p><p>要是当时有人这么跟我说，我肯定会笑他。在学校不受欢迎会让孩子痛苦，有些孩子甚至会因此自杀。说我不想受欢迎，就像对沙漠里快渴死的人说他不想要一杯水一样荒唐。我当然想受欢迎。</p><p>But in fact I didn’t, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things.</p><p>但事实是，我没那么想 —— 至少没那么强烈。我有更想追求的东西：变得聪明。这不只是在学校考个好成绩（虽然那也有点用），而是设计漂亮的火箭、写好文章，或是搞懂怎么编程。总的来说，是创造伟大的事物。</p><p>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn’t have taken it.</p><p>那时候我从没试着把自己的欲望分开权衡。要是权衡过，我就会发现 “变聪明” 更重要。要是有人说能让我成为全校最受欢迎的孩子，但条件是我的智力得降到平均水平（姑且这么假设），我是不会答应的。</p><p>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don’t think many nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn’t drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired by everyone?</p><p>尽管不受欢迎让书呆子们很难受，但我觉得大多数人都不会接受这个交易。对他们来说，“智力平平” 是无法忍受的。但大多数孩子会接受 —— 对一半的人来说，这都是进步。就算是智力排在前 20% 的人（按当时大家的理解，智力是单一维度的），谁不想用 30 分的智力换所有人的喜爱和崇拜呢？</p><p>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.</p><p>我想，这就是问题的根源。书呆子有两个 “主人”：他们当然想受欢迎，但更想变聪明。而在竞争激烈的美国中学里，受欢迎这事儿可没法在 “业余时间” 搞定。</p><p>Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that “no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.” I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year.</p><p>阿尔贝蒂 —— 可以说是文艺复兴时期 “全才” 的典范 —— 曾写道：“任何技艺，无论多微不足道，若想精通，都需全身心投入。” 我怀疑这世上有没有人比美国学生为了受欢迎更拼命。相比之下，海豹突击队队员和神经外科住院医生都像懒汉 —— 他们偶尔还能休假，有些人甚至有爱好。而美国青少年可能一年 365 天，醒着的每一刻都在为 “受欢迎” 努力。</p><p>I don’t mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers are always on duty as conformists.</p><p>我不是说他们是有意识地这么做。有些孩子确实像小马基雅维利，但我真正想表达的是：青少年时刻都在 “扮演” 合群的人。</p><p>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don’t consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good. But to who? To the other kids. Other kids’ opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they make to do things “right” is also, consciously or not, an effort to be more popular.</p><p>比如，青少年很在意穿着。他们不是故意穿得受欢迎，而是想穿得好看。但 “好看” 是给谁看的？给其他孩子看。其他孩子的看法成了他们判断 “正确” 的标准 —— 不仅是衣服，几乎所有事都如此，甚至包括走路的姿势。所以，他们为 “做好一件事” 付出的所有努力，无论有意识还是无意识，都是为了更受欢迎。</p><p>Nerds don’t realize this. They don’t realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field don’t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall. In fact, most people who “can draw” like drawing, and have spent many hours doing it; that’s why they’re good at it. Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.</p><p>书呆子没意识到这一点。他们没意识到 “受欢迎” 需要付出努力。一般来说，不在某个高要求领域的人，都意识不到成功需要持续（往往是无意识的）的努力。比如，大多数人觉得画画是一种天赋，就像长得高一样。但事实上，大多数 “会画画” 的人是因为喜欢画，花了很多时间练习，所以才擅长。同理，受欢迎不是 “是” 或 “不是” 的状态，而是需要自己去争取的。</p><p>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties. They’re like someone trying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.</p><p>书呆子不受欢迎的主要原因是：他们有其他事情要思考。他们的注意力在书本或自然世界上，而不是时尚和派对。这就像有人想一边踢足球，一边在头顶平衡一杯水。其他能全神贯注踢球的人会轻松击败他们，还会纳闷他们怎么这么笨。</p><p>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please.</p><p>就算书呆子和其他孩子一样在乎受欢迎，对他们来说，变受欢迎也要更费劲。受欢迎的孩子学会受欢迎、渴望受欢迎的方式，和书呆子学会变聪明、渴望变聪明的方式一样 —— 都是从父母那里学来的。当书呆子被训练着 “得出正确答案” 时，受欢迎的孩子正被训练着 “讨人喜欢”。</p><p>So far I’ve been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd, using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it’s only the context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn’t socially adept enough. But “enough” depends on where you are. In a typical American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least, so specific) that you don’t have to be especially awkward to look awkward by comparison.</p><p>到目前为止，我一直在模糊 “聪明” 和 “书呆子” 的关系，把它们当同义词用。但其实这取决于环境。书呆子是那些社交能力不够的人，但 “够不够” 要看具体场合。在典型的美国学校里，“酷” 的标准太高（或者说太特殊），所以哪怕你只是稍微有点笨拙，看起来也会很显眼。</p><p>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they’ll tend to become nerds. And that’s why smart people’s lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.</p><p>很少有聪明的孩子能分出足够的精力去追求受欢迎。除非他们碰巧长得好看、是天生的运动员，或是受欢迎孩子的兄弟姐妹，否则他们很可能会变成书呆子。这就是为什么聪明人在 11 到 17 岁左右的日子最难过 —— 这个年纪的生活，远比之前或之后更围绕 “受欢迎” 展开。</p><p>Before that, kids’ lives are dominated by their parents, not by other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school, but this isn’t their whole life, as it later becomes.</p><p>在这之前，孩子的生活由父母主导，而不是同龄人。小学时，孩子确实在乎同伴的看法，但这不是他们生活的全部，后来却成了全部。</p><p>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family. Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the world they care about.</p><p>但到了 11 岁左右，孩子们似乎开始把家庭当成 “日常任务”。他们在彼此之间创造了一个新世界，在这个世界里的地位才重要，而不是在家庭里的地位。事实上，在家庭里惹麻烦，甚至能在他们在乎的那个世界里加分。</p><p>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at first a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds to their own devices, what you get is Lord of the Flies. Like a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed entirely believable, I didn’t get the additional message. I wish they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world was stupid.</p><p>问题是，孩子们为自己创造的这个世界，一开始非常粗糙。要是让一群 11 岁的孩子自己待着，结果就会像《蝇王》里写的那样。和很多美国孩子一样，我在学校里读过这本书。这大概不是巧合 —— 大概有人想告诉我们，我们是野蛮人，我们创造了一个残酷又愚蠢的世界。但这对我来说太隐晦了。虽然书里的内容看起来完全可信，但我没 get 到那个深层信息。真希望他们直接告诉我们：我们是野蛮人，我们的世界很愚蠢。</p><p>Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted.</p><p>要是不受欢迎仅仅意味着被忽视，书呆子或许还能忍受。但不幸的是，在学校里不受欢迎，就意味着会被主动排挤。</p><p>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But they could be. Adults don’t normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage kids do it?</p><p>为什么？现在还在上学的人可能又会觉得这问题很奇怪 —— 事情难道还能是别的样子吗？但确实可以是别的样子。成年人一般不会排挤书呆子，为什么青少年会呢？</p><p>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing.</p><p>部分原因是，青少年还半是孩子，很多孩子天生就残忍。有些孩子折磨书呆子，就像他们扯掉蜘蛛的腿一样 —— 在良知形成之前，折磨是有趣的。</p><p>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I’ve read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.</p><p>另一个原因是，孩子们通过排挤书呆子来自我安慰。就像踩水时，你要把水往下推才能让自己浮起来。同理，在任何社会等级中，对自己地位不确定的人，会通过欺负他们认为等级更低的人来强调自己的地位。我读过相关内容，说这就是为什么美国的贫穷白人是对黑人最不友好的群体。</p><p>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it’s part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It’s much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.</p><p>但我觉得，其他孩子排挤书呆子的主要原因是：这是 “受欢迎机制” 的一部分。受欢迎不仅取决于个人魅力，更多取决于 “联盟”。要想更受欢迎，你得不断做些能让自己和其他受欢迎的人拉近距离的事，而没有什么比共同的敌人更能拉近人了。</p><p>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy if there isn’t a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.</p><p>就像政客想转移选民对国内困境的注意力一样，要是没有真正的敌人，你可以创造一个。通过孤立和排挤某个书呆子，一群等级更高的孩子能巩固彼此的关系。攻击外来者，能让他们都成为 “自己人”。这就是为什么最严重的欺凌往往是群体性的。问问任何一个书呆子就知道：一群孩子的欺负，比任何单个恶霸的虐待都要可怕，无论那个恶霸多残忍。</p><p>If it’s any consolation to the nerds, it’s nothing personal. The group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together to go hunting. They don’t actually hate you. They just need something to chase.</p><p>要是能给书呆子一点安慰的话，那就是：这不是针对个人。那些联合起来欺负你的孩子，和一群一起去打猎的人做的是同一件事，原因也一样 —— 他们不是真的恨你，只是需要个东西来追。</p><p>Because they’re at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don’t persecute nerds; they don’t need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.</p><p>因为书呆子处于等级的最底层，所以他们成了全校都能安全攻击的目标。我记得很清楚，最受欢迎的孩子不会排挤书呆子 —— 他们没必要降低身份做这种事。大多数排挤来自中间阶层的孩子，那些焦虑的 “中产”。</p><p>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want to pick on nerds than there are nerds.</p><p>麻烦的是，这种孩子太多了。受欢迎程度的分布不是金字塔，而是像梨一样，底部很尖。最不受欢迎的群体非常小（我记得我们的午餐桌地图里，D 桌只有我们）。所以，想欺负书呆子的人，比书呆子本身还多。</p><p>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.</p><p>除了通过疏远不受欢迎的人来加分，和他们走得近还会减分。我认识一个女人说，高中时她喜欢书呆子，但不敢让人看到她和他们说话，因为其他女孩会嘲笑她。不受欢迎是一种 “传染病”—— 就算是不忍心欺负书呆子的孩子，为了自保也会疏远他们。</p><p>It’s no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle school and high school. Their other interests leave them little attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the situation.</p><p>难怪聪明的孩子在初中和高中容易不开心。他们的其他兴趣让他们没精力去追求受欢迎，而由于受欢迎就像零和游戏，这反过来又让他们成了全校的目标。奇怪的是，这种噩梦般的场景并非源于刻意的恶意，只是由环境本身的结构造成的。</p><p>For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I’ve talked to agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.</p><p>对我来说，最糟糕的是初中时期 —— 那时候，“孩子文化” 刚形成，还很残酷，而后来能逐渐把聪明孩子分开的 “专业化” 才刚刚开始。几乎所有我聊过的人都同意：低谷在 11 到 14 岁之间。</p><p>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.</p><p>我们学校是八年级，那时我 12 到 13 岁。那年有件事引起了短暂的轰动：一位老师无意中听到一群女孩在等校车时的谈话，震惊之下，第二天整堂课都在慷慨陈词，呼吁她们不要对彼此那么残忍。</p><p>It didn’t have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn’t know the kind of things they say to one another? You mean this isn’t normal?</p><p>但这没什么明显效果。当时让我震惊的是她的 “惊讶”—— 难道她不知道她们会对彼此说这种话吗？难道这不是正常的吗？</p><p>It’s important to realize that, no, the adults don’t know what the kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like us, they don’t like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don’t see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.</p><p>重要的是要明白：不，成年人根本不知道孩子们在彼此做什么。他们抽象地知道，孩子们会残忍地对待彼此，就像我们抽象地知道贫穷国家有人遭受酷刑一样。但和我们一样，他们不想细想这个令人沮丧的事实，而且除非刻意去看，否则他们看不到具体的虐待证据。</p><p>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens’ main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I’ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.</p><p>公立学校的老师，处境很像监狱看守。看守最关心的是把囚犯关在范围内，给他们饭吃，尽可能防止他们互相残杀。除此之外，他们不想和囚犯有太多交集，所以让他们自己形成社会结构。据我所知，囚犯们创造的社会是扭曲、野蛮且无处不在的，处于底层的人日子尤其难过。</p><p>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that they didn’t want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we created was barbaric.</p><p>我就读的学校，大体也是如此。最重要的是把孩子留在校园里。在学校里，校方给他们饭吃，阻止公然的暴力，还会努力教点东西。但除此之外，他们不想和孩子有太多牵扯。就像监狱看守一样，老师大多让我们自生自灭。而我们创造的文化，也像囚犯的文化一样野蛮。</p><p>Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that the answer is simply that it’s populated by adults, who are too mature to pick on one another. But I don’t think this is true. Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently, do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.</p><p>为什么现实世界对书呆子更友好？似乎答案是：现实世界里都是成年人，他们成熟到不会互相排挤。但我不这么认为。监狱里的成年人当然会互相排挤，显然，某些社交圈里的贵妇也是如此 —— 在曼哈顿的某些地方，女人的生活听起来就像高中的延续，充满了同样琐碎的勾心斗角。</p><p>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it’s populated by adults, but that it’s very large, and the things you do have real effects. That’s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.</p><p>我觉得现实世界的关键不是 “都是成年人”，而是它足够大，而且你做的事会产生真实的影响。这正是学校、监狱和 “贵妇社交圈” 所缺乏的。在那些世界里，人们被困在小泡泡里，做什么都只能产生局部影响。这种社会自然会堕落成野蛮状态 —— 它们的形式没有对应的功能。</p><p>When the things you do have real effects, it’s no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers, and that’s where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills, he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.</p><p>当你做的事有真实影响时，仅仅 “讨人喜欢” 就不够了。“得出正确答案” 开始变得重要，而这正是书呆子的优势。比尔・盖茨就是个例子 —— 尽管他的社交能力出了名地差，但他能得出正确答案（至少从收入来看是这样）。</p><p>The other thing that’s different about the real world is that it’s much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the wall as he walked down a corridor.</p><p>现实世界的另一个不同是它足够大。在足够大的群体里，哪怕是最小的少数群体，只要聚集起来就能形成 “临界质量”。在现实世界里，书呆子会聚集在某些地方，形成自己的社会，在那里智力是最重要的。有时风向甚至会反过来：尤其是在大学的数学系和科学系，书呆子会故意放大自己的笨拙，来显得更聪明。约翰・纳什非常崇拜诺伯特・维纳，甚至学他走路时扶着墙的习惯。</p><p>As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn’t have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, the world. The world seemed cruel and boring, and I’m not sure which was worse.</p><p>13 岁时，我的眼界只限于眼前的世界。我以为我们生活的那个扭曲的小世界就是全部世界。这个世界既残酷又无聊，我都不知道哪个更糟。</p><p>Because I didn’t fit into this world, I thought that something must be wrong with me. I didn’t realize that the reason we nerds didn’t fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others.</p><p>因为我不适应这个世界，我觉得一定是自己有问题。但我没意识到，书呆子不适应的原因，在某些方面是因为我们领先了一步 —— 我们已经在思考现实世界中重要的事，而不是像其他人那样，把所有时间都花在玩一个严苛却多半无意义的游戏上。</p><p>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school. He wouldn’t know the right clothes to wear, the right music to like, the right slang to use. He’d seem to the kids a complete alien. The thing is, he’d know enough not to care what they thought. We had no such confidence.</p><p>我们有点像突然被扔回初中的成年人 —— 他不知道该穿什么衣服、该喜欢什么音乐、该说什么俚语，在孩子们看来就是个彻头彻尾的异类。但关键是，他知道不必在乎孩子们的看法。而我们没有这种自信。</p><p>A lot of people seem to think it’s good for smart kids to be thrown together with “normal” kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don’t fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a “pep rally” at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual.</p><p>很多人似乎认为，让聪明的孩子在这个阶段和 “正常” 孩子混在一起是好事。或许吧。但至少在某些情况下，书呆子不适应的原因，真的是其他人太疯狂了。我记得高中时坐在 “ pep rally”（动员大会）的观众席上，看着啦啦队员把对手球员的模拟像扔到观众席上让大家撕碎，感觉自己像个探险家，目睹着某种怪异的部落仪式。</p><p>If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice, the main thing I’d tell him would be to stick his head up and look around. I didn’t really grasp it at the time, but the whole world we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children.</p><p>要是能回到过去，给 13 岁的自己一点建议，我最想说的是：抬起头，看看周围。那时候我没意识到，我们生活的整个世界，就像奶油蛋糕一样虚假 —— 不只是学校，整个小镇都是。人们为什么搬到郊区？为了养孩子！所以难怪这里显得无聊又乏味 —— 整个地方就是个巨大的托儿所，一个为了养孩子而刻意创造的人造小镇。</p><p>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing to do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could endanger children.</p><p>我长大的地方，感觉无处可去，无事可做。这不是偶然 —— 郊区的设计就是为了隔绝外部世界，因为外部世界有会伤害孩子的东西。</p><p>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.</p><p>至于学校，不过是这个虚假世界里的 “拘留所”。官方说学校的目的是教孩子，但实际上，主要目的是把孩子关在一个地方一整天，好让成年人能做事。这一点我没意见：在一个专业化的工业社会里，让孩子乱跑会是灾难。</p><p>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that (a) they aren’t told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they’re called misfits.</p><p>让我不满的不是孩子被关在 “监狱” 里，而是：（a）没人告诉他们这一点；（b）“监狱” 主要由 “囚犯” 管理。孩子们被送去花六年时间背诵无意义的知识，而这个世界由一群追着椭圆形棕色球跑的 “巨人” 统治，仿佛这是世界上最自然的事。要是他们对这种荒诞的设定有异议，就会被叫做 “不合群的人”。</p><p>Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just for the nerds. Like any war, it’s damaging even to the winners.</p><p>在这个扭曲的世界里，孩子们的生活充满压力 —— 不只是书呆子。就像任何战争一样，即使是赢家也会受伤。</p><p>Adults can’t avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why don’t they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty. The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that monstrous new chemicals, hormones, are now coursing through their bloodstream and messing up everything. There’s nothing wrong with the system; it’s just inevitable that kids will be miserable at that age.</p><p>成年人不可能没发现青少年在受苦，那为什么不做点什么？因为他们把这归咎于青春期。成年人告诉自己，孩子之所以不开心，是因为可怕的新化学物质 —— 荷尔蒙 —— 在他们的血液里流动，把一切都搞乱了。制度没问题，孩子在这个年纪痛苦是不可避免的。</p><p>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which probably doesn’t help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing the wrong size shoes.</p><p>这种想法太普遍了，连孩子自己都信，这可能更糟。要是有人觉得自己的脚天生就疼，他是不会停下来想想可能是鞋不合脚的。</p><p>I’m suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are intrinsically messed up. If it’s physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I’ve read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they weren’t crazy.</p><p>我很怀疑 “13 岁的孩子天生就会捣乱” 这种说法。要是这是生理原因，那应该是普遍现象。蒙古游牧民族的 13 岁孩子都很虚无主义吗？我读了很多历史，没在 20 世纪之前见过任何关于这种 “普遍现象” 的记载。文艺复兴时期的学徒青少年，似乎都很快乐、很积极。他们当然也会打架、互相恶作剧（米开朗基罗的鼻子就被恶霸打断过），但他们不疯狂。</p><p>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia. I don’t think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they’re made to lead. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere.</p><p>据我所知，“荷尔蒙驱动的疯狂青少年” 这种概念，和郊区的出现是同时的。我觉得这不是巧合 —— 青少年被他们被迫过的生活逼疯了。文艺复兴时期的学徒是 “工作犬”，现在的青少年是 “神经质的宠物犬”。他们的疯狂，和所有无所事事的人</p><p>When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter kids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and some may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic. But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.</p><p>我上学时，自杀是聪明孩子间的常见话题。我认识的人中没人真的这么做，但有几个计划过，有些人可能尝试过。多数时候，这只是一种姿态 —— 和其他青少年一样，我们喜欢戏剧化的东西，而自杀看起来很有戏剧性。但部分原因是，我们的生活有时确实很痛苦。</p><p>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on. Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity. And all the work we did was pointless, or seemed so at the time.</p><p>霸凌只是问题的一部分。另一个问题，或许更严重的是，我们从来没有真正有意义的事可做。人类喜欢工作；在世界上大多数地方，工作是身份的一部分。而我们做的所有事都毫无意义，至少当时看来是这样。</p><p>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future, so far that we didn’t even know at the time what we were practicing for. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump through, words without content designed mainly for testability. (The three main causes of the Civil War were…. Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)</p><p>往好里说，这些事是为遥远未来的真正工作做准备，但未来太远了，我们当时甚至不知道在为什么做准备。更多时候，这些事只是一系列随意设定的 “关卡”—— 空洞的文字，主要是为了方便考试。（比如：内战的三个主要原因是…… 考试题目：列出内战的三个主要原因。）</p><p>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among themselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way to escape this empty life was to submit to it.</p><p>而且没有退出的办法。大人们一致认为，这是通往大学的必经之路。逃离这种空虚生活的唯一方式，就是屈服于它。</p><p>Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They weren’t left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.</p><p>过去的青少年在社会中扮演更积极的角色。前工业化时代，他们都是某种学徒，无论是在商店、农场，甚至军舰上。他们不会被丢去自己创造社会，而是成年人社会的初级成员。</p><p>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is precious little) between schoolwork and the work they’ll do as adults.</p><p>那时候的青少年似乎更尊重成年人，因为成年人是他们想学的技能的可见专家。现在，大多数孩子几乎不知道父母在遥远的办公室里做什么，也看不到学业和未来工作之间的联系（事实上，这种联系也确实少得可怜）。</p><p>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use for teenagers. After a couple years’ training, an apprentice could be a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry messages or sweep the workshop.</p><p>如果说过去的青少年更尊重成年人，那成年人也更需要青少年。经过几年培训，学徒就能真正帮上忙。就算是最新来的学徒，也能被派去送信或打扫车间。</p><p>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in the way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they were going away for the weekend.</p><p>现在的成年人对青少年没有即时需求。他们在办公室里只会碍手碍脚。所以大人们上班时把他们送到学校，就像周末出门时把狗送到 kennel（犬舍）一样。</p><p>What happened? We’re up against a hard one here. The cause of this problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization. As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them. Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far earlier. Now kids who go to college don’t start working full-time till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not finish your training till 30.</p><p>到底发生了什么？这是个棘手的问题。导致这个问题的原因，和导致许多现存问题的原因一样：专业化。随着工作越来越专业化，我们需要更长时间的培训。前工业化时代的孩子最晚 14 岁就开始工作；大多数人生活的农场里，孩子开始工作的时间更早。现在，上大学的孩子要到 21 或 22 岁才开始全职工作。有些学位，比如医学博士或哲学博士，可能要到 30 岁才能完成培训。</p><p>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost any other kind of work, they’d be a net loss. But they’re also too young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.</p><p>现在的青少年没什么用，除了在快餐等行业做廉价劳动力 —— 这些行业的发展正是为了利用这一点。在几乎所有其他工作中，他们都是 “净亏损”。但他们又太年轻，不能没人看管。总得有人看着他们，最有效的方式就是把他们集中在一个地方，让几个成年人就能看管所有人。</p><p>If you stop there, what you’re describing is literally a prison, albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically do stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids. But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don’t really take it seriously– not even the smart kids. Much of the time we were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.</p><p>如果事情只到这一步，那描述的简直就是监狱，尽管是兼职的。问题是，很多学校实际上就止步于此。学校宣称的目的是教育孩子，但没有外部压力要求他们做好这件事。所以大多数学校教得一塌糊涂，孩子们根本不当回事 —— 即使是聪明的孩子也一样。很多时候，我们所有人，无论是学生还是老师，都只是在走过场。</p><p>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo’s Les Miserables. I don’t think any of us knew French well enough to make our way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I just skimmed the Cliff’s Notes. When we were given a test on the book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of long words that our teacher wouldn’t have used. Where had these questions come from? From the Cliff’s Notes, it turned out. The teacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.</p><p>我高中的法语课上，我们本该读雨果的《悲惨世界》。但我觉得我们中没人的法语好到能读懂这本巨著。和班上其他人一样，我只是浏览了《克利夫笔记》（名著摘要）。考试时，我发现题目听起来很奇怪 —— 满是老师不会用的长单词。这些题目来自哪里？结果是《克利夫笔记》。老师也在用。我们都在装样子。</p><p>There are certainly great public school teachers. The energy and imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that year something his students still talk about, thirty years later. But teachers like him were individuals swimming upstream. They couldn’t fix the system.</p><p>当然，公立学校里有很棒的老师。我四年级的老师米哈尔科先生，他的活力和想象力让那一年成了学生们三十年后还在谈论的话题。但像他这样的老师，只是逆流而上的个体，无法改变整个系统。</p><p>In almost any group of people you’ll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it’s generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.</p><p>几乎任何群体中都存在等级制度。现实世界中，成年人形成群体通常是为了某个共同目标，而领导者最终是那些最擅长实现目标的人。大多数学校的问题在于，它们没有目标。但等级制度必须存在，所以孩子们凭空创造了一个。</p><p>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation degenerates into a popularity contest. And that’s exactly what happens in most American schools. Instead of depending on some real test, one’s rank depends mostly on one’s ability to increase one’s rank. It’s like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the kids become one another’s opponents.</p><p>我们有个短语来描述 “没有有意义的标准却要排名” 的情况：我们说这种情况会退化成 “ popularity contest（人气竞赛）”。这正是大多数美国学校的现状。一个人的排名不取决于任何真正的考验，而主要取决于他提升自己排名的能力。就像路易十四的宫廷 —— 没有外部对手，所以孩子们就成了彼此的对手。</p><p>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn’t painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team doesn’t resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him. The veteran may in turn feel a sense of noblesse oblige. And most importantly, their status depends on how well they do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.</p><p>当存在真正的外部技能考验时，处于等级底层并不痛苦。足球队的新手不会嫉妒老将的技能；他希望有一天能像老将一样，并且很高兴有机会向他学习。老将反过来可能会有 “noblesse oblige（位高则任重）” 的责任感。最重要的是，他们的地位取决于对抗外部对手的表现，而不是能否打压他人。</p><p>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society debases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the bottom, nor noblesse oblige at the top. It’s kill or be killed.</p><p>宫廷式的等级制度则完全不同。这种社会会贬低所有进入其中的人。底层没有钦佩，顶层没有责任感。这是一个要么踩别人，要么被别人踩的世界。</p><p>This is the sort of society that gets created in American secondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain number of hours each day. What I didn’t realize at the time, and in fact didn’t realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same cause.</p><p>这就是美国中学里形成的社会。之所以会这样，是因为这些学校除了把孩子们每天关在一个地方几小时之外，没有任何真正的目的。我当时没意识到，直到最近才明白：学校生活的两大恐怖 —— 残忍和无聊，有着相同的根源。</p><p>The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness that actively drives kids away from the things they’re supposed to be learning.</p><p>美国公立学校的平庸造成的后果，远不止让孩子们在六年里不开心。它滋生了叛逆，让孩子们主动远离他们本该学习的东西。</p><p>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I could bring myself to read anything we’d been assigned then. And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like “character” and “integrity” because they had been so debased by adults. As they were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing: obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers. If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of them.</p><p>和很多书呆子一样，高中毕业后过了很多年，我才愿意读那些当年被布置的读物。我失去的不止是书籍。我不信任 “character（品格）” 和 “ integrity（正直）” 这类词，因为成年人把它们贬低了。在当时的语境里，这些词似乎都意味着同一个东西：服从。因这些品质而受表扬的孩子，往好里说是愚钝的 “奖牛”，往坏里说是油滑的奉承者。如果这就是品格和正直，我一点也不想要。</p><p>The word I most misunderstood was “tact.” As used by adults, it seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut. I assumed it was derived from the same root as “tacit” and “taciturn,” and that it literally meant being quiet. I vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut me up. In fact, it’s derived from the same root as “tactile,” and what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of clumsy. I don’t think I learned this until college.</p><p>我最误解的词是 “tact（得体）”。在成年人的用法里，它似乎意味着闭嘴。我以为它和 “ tacit（默许的）”、“ taciturn（沉默寡言的）” 同源，字面意思就是安静。我发誓永远不要 “得体”，他们别想让我闭嘴。但事实上，它和 “ tactile（触觉的）” 同源，意思是 “灵巧的手法”。“得体” 是 “笨拙” 的反义词。我大概到大学才明白这一点。</p><p>Nerds aren’t the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are unpopular because they’re distracted. There are other kids who deliberately opt out because they’re so disgusted with the whole process.</p><p>在人气竞赛中，书呆子不是唯一的输家。书呆子不受欢迎是因为他们分心了。还有些孩子因为对整个过程极度反感，故意选择退出。</p><p>Teenage kids, even rebels, don’t like to be alone, so when kids opt out of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana. The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called “freaks.”</p><p>青少年即使是叛逆者，也不喜欢独处，所以当他们选择退出系统时，往往会结成群体。在我就读的学校里，叛逆的焦点是吸毒，特别是大麻。这个群体的孩子穿黑色摇滚 T 恤，被叫做 “freaks（怪胎）”。</p><p>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap between them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids, though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an important tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was friends with a lot of freaks.</p><p>怪胎和书呆子是盟友，两者有很多重叠。怪胎总体上比其他孩子聪明，尽管 “从不学习（或至少看起来不学习）” 是这个群体的重要价值观。我更属于书呆子阵营，但和很多怪胎是朋友。</p><p>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they created. It was something to do together, and because the drugs were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.</p><p>他们吸毒，至少一开始是为了建立社交联系。这是他们可以一起做的事，而且因为毒品是非法的，这成了他们共同的叛逆标志。</p><p>I’m not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum. No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from other problems– trouble at home, for example. But, in my school at least, the reason most kids started using drugs was rebellion. Fourteen-year-olds didn’t start smoking pot because they’d heard it would help them forget their problems. They started because they wanted to join a different tribe.</p><p>我不是说糟糕的学校是孩子们陷入毒品问题的全部原因。过一段时间后，毒品会有自己的惯性。毫无疑问，有些怪胎最终吸毒是为了逃避其他问题 —— 比如家庭麻烦。但至少在我的学校里，大多数孩子开始吸毒的原因是叛逆。14 岁的孩子开始抽大麻，不是因为听说这能帮他们忘记烦恼，而是因为他们想加入另一个群体。</p><p>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves the cause of the problem.</p><p>暴政滋生叛乱，这不是什么新观点。但当局大多仍然表现得好像毒品本身就是问题的根源。</p><p>The real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won’t see solutions till adults realize that. The adults who may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in school. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as you were? I wouldn’t. Well, then, is there anything we can do to fix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the current system. It has come about mostly by default.</p><p>真正的问题是学校生活的空虚。除非成年人意识到这一点，否则我们看不到解决方案。最先意识到这一点的成年人，可能是那些自己上学时是书呆子的人。你想让你的孩子在八年级时和你当年一样不开心吗？我不想。那么，我们能做些什么来改变现状呢？几乎可以肯定的是，现行制度并非不可改变，它的形成很大程度上是默认的结果。</p><p>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing. Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few will have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest part is realizing that you can.</p><p>但成年人很忙。出席学校的戏剧表演是一回事，对抗教育官僚体系是另一回事。或许有少数人有精力尝试改变，但我怀疑最难的是意识到 “自己有能力改变”。</p><p>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to rescue you, but they probably won’t be coming this month. Any immediate improvement in nerds’ lives is probably going to have to come from the nerds themselves.</p><p>还在上学的书呆子别抱太大期望。也许有一天，一队全副武装的成年人会乘直升机来救你们，但这个月可能不会。书呆子生活的任何即时改善，很可能都得靠他们自己。</p><p>Merely understanding the situation they’re in should make it less painful. Nerds aren’t losers. They’re just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It’s hard to find successful adults now who don’t claim to have been nerds in high school.</p><p>仅仅理解自己所处的环境，就应该能减少痛苦。书呆子不是失败者。他们只是在玩另一种游戏，一种更接近现实世界的游戏。成年人明白这一点 —— 现在很难找到成功的成年人不宣称自己高中时是书呆子。</p><p>It’s important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It’s all-encompassing, like life, but it isn’t the real thing. It’s only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you’re still in it.</p><p>书呆子也需要意识到，学校不是生活。学校是一种奇怪的人造产物，一半无菌，一半野性。它像生活一样包罗万象，但不是真实的生活。它只是暂时的，即使还在其中，只要你愿意，就能看到它之外的东西。</p><p>If life seems awful to kids, it’s neither because hormones are turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because life actually is awful (as you believe). It’s because the adults, who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do. Any society of that type is awful to live in. You don’t have to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.</p><p>如果孩子们觉得生活很糟糕，既不是因为荷尔蒙把你们都变成了怪物（就像父母认为的那样），也不是因为生活本身真的很糟糕（就像你们认为的那样）。而是因为，不再有经济用途的成年人，把你们丢在一起，让你们多年来无所事事。任何这样的社会，生活起来都很糟糕。这就足以解释为什么青少年不开心了。</p><p>I’ve said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis is an optimistic one– that several problems we take for granted are in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently unhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults both.</p><p>我在这篇文章里说了些尖锐的话，但核心论点其实是乐观的 —— 一些我们习以为常的问题，其实并非无法解决。青少年并非天生就是不开心的怪物。这对孩子和成年人来说，都应该是个鼓舞人心的消息。</p>]]></content>

April 2003 </p><p>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.) In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb. Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface. </p><p>（本文源自 2001 年 Franz 开发者研讨会的一次演讲）</p><p>1995 年夏天，我和我的朋友罗伯特・莫里斯创办了一家名为 Viaweb 的初创公司。我们计划编写一款软件，让终端用户能够构建在线商店。这款软件在当时的新颖之处在于，它运行在我们的服务器上，使用普通网页作为界面。</p><p>A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer. </p><p>当然，很多人可能同时都有过这个想法，但据我所知，Viaweb 是第一款基于网络的应用程序。这个想法对我们来说非常新颖，于是我们用它来为公司命名：Viaweb，因为我们的软件是通过网络运行的，而不是在桌面计算机上运行。</p><p>Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1] </p><p>这款软件的另一个不寻常之处在于，它主要是用一种名为 Lisp 的编程语言编写的。它是最早一批用 Lisp 编写的大型终端用户应用程序之一，在此之前，Lisp 主要在大学和研究实验室中使用。</p><p>The Secret Weapon </p><p>Eric Raymond has written an essay called “How to Become a Hacker,” and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker should consider learning Lisp: </p><p><strong>秘密武器</strong></p><p>埃里克・雷蒙德写过一篇名为《如何成为一名黑客》的文章，在文中，他除了讲述其他内容外，还告诉未来的黑客应该学习哪些语言。他建议从 Python 和 Java 入手，因为它们容易学习。认真的黑客还会想学习 C 语言，以便对 Unix 进行黑客攻击，以及学习 Perl 用于系统管理和 CGI 脚本。最后，真正认真的黑客应该考虑学习 Lisp：</p><blockquote><p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>学习 Lisp 是值得的，因为当你最终掌握它时，你将获得深刻的启发；这种体验将使你在余生中成为一名更优秀的程序员，即使你实际上并不经常使用 Lisp。</p></blockquote><p>This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won’t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages you do want to use, like English. </p><p>这和你经常听到的学习拉丁语的理由是一样的。它不会让你找到一份工作，除非你可能成为一名古典文学教授，但它会提升你的思维，让你在你想用的语言（比如英语）中成为一名更好的作家。</p><p>But wait a minute. This metaphor doesn’t stretch that far. The reason Latin won’t get you a job is that no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer, tell them to. </p><p>但等一下。这个比喻并不完全恰当。拉丁语不会让你找到工作的原因是没有人说拉丁语。如果你用拉丁语写作，没有人能理解你。但 Lisp 是一种计算机语言，计算机可以理解程序员告诉它们的任何语言。</p><p>So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn’t you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn’t he? I’m not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won’t use it. </p><p>那么，如果像他说的那样，Lisp 能让你成为更好的程序员，为什么你不想使用它呢？如果一个画家得到了一支能让他画得更好的画笔，在我看来，他会想在所有画作中都使用它，不是吗？我这里并不是想取笑埃里克・雷蒙德。总的来说，他的建议是好的。他关于 Lisp 的说法几乎是一种传统观点。但这种传统观点存在一个矛盾：Lisp 能让你成为更好的程序员，但你却不会使用它。</p><p>Why not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn’t, then who needs it? </p><p>为什么不呢？编程语言毕竟只是工具。如果 Lisp 真的能编写出更好的程序，你就应该使用它。如果不能，那谁还需要它呢？</p><p>This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you’re starting a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you. </p><p>这不仅仅是一个理论问题。软件行业是一个竞争非常激烈的行业，容易出现自然垄断。在其他条件相同的情况下，一个能够更快、更好地编写软件的公司会让其竞争对手破产。而当你创办一家初创公司时，你会深刻地感受到这一点。初创公司往往是一种要么全有要么全无的事情。你要么发财，要么一无所有。在初创公司中，如果你押错了技术，你的竞争对手就会把你击垮。</p><p>Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn’t see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also knew that that didn’t mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you’d be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best. </p><p>罗伯特和我都很熟悉 Lisp，我们找不到任何理由不相信自己的直觉并选择 Lisp。我们知道其他人都在用 C++ 或 Perl 编写软件。但我们也知道这并不意味着什么。如果你以那种方式选择技术，你就会选择运行 Windows。当你选择技术时，你必须忽略其他人在做什么，只考虑什么是最有效的。</p><p>This is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can’t do what all the other startups do. I don’t think a lot of people realize this, even in startups. </p><p>这在初创公司中尤其如此。在大公司里，你可以做其他大公司都在做的事情。但初创公司不能做其他初创公司都在做的事情。我认为很多人甚至在初创公司中都没有意识到这一点。</p><p>The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you’re running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company– that is, to grow about ten percent a year. </p><p>一般的大公司每年增长约 10%。所以，如果你经营一家大公司，并且你像一般的大公司那样做所有事情，你可以期望取得和一般大公司一样的业绩，即每年增长约 10%。</p><p>The same thing will happen if you’re running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you’ll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you’re running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you’re in trouble. </p><p>当然，如果你经营一家初创公司，情况也是如此。如果你像一般的初创公司那样做所有事情，你应该期望得到平均水平的业绩。但问题是，平均水平的业绩意味着你会倒闭。初创公司的存活率远低于 50%。所以，如果你经营一家初创公司，你最好做一些与众不同的事情。否则，你就会有麻烦。</p><p>Back in 1995, we knew something that I don’t think our competitors understood, and few understand even now: when you’re writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. When you’re writing desktop software, there’s a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want. </p><p>早在 1995 年，我们就知道一些我认为我们的竞争对手不理解的事情，甚至现在也很少有人理解：当你编写只需要在自己服务器上运行的软件时，你可以使用任何你想用的语言。当你编写桌面软件时，人们强烈倾向于使用与操作系统相同的语言来编写应用程序。十年前，编写应用程序意味着用 C 语言编写。但对于基于网络的软件，特别是当你拥有语言和操作系统的源代码时，你可以使用任何你想用的语言。</p><p>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not. </p><p>然而，这种新的自由是一把双刃剑。既然你可以使用任何语言，你就必须考虑使用哪一种。那些试图假装一切都没有改变的公司可能会发现，他们的竞争对手并非如此。</p><p>If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it’s done. </p><p>如果你可以使用任何语言，你会选择哪种呢？我们选择了 Lisp。一方面，很明显，在这个市场中快速开发非常重要。我们都是从零开始，所以一家能够比竞争对手更快实现新功能的公司将拥有巨大的优势。我们知道 Lisp 是一种非常适合快速编写软件的语言，而且基于服务器的应用程序会放大快速开发的效果，因为你可以在软件完成后立即发布。</p><p>If other companies didn’t want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn’t know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take. </p><p>如果其他公司不想使用 Lisp，那就更好了。这可能会给我们带来技术优势，而我们需要所有能得到的帮助。当我们创办 Viaweb 时，我们没有商业经验。我们对营销、招聘、融资或获取客户一无所知。我们俩甚至都没有过所谓的真正的工作。我们唯一擅长的就是编写软件。我们希望这能拯救我们。我们会抓住在软件方面能得到的任何优势。</p><p>So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we’d be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn’t do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn’t need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway. </p><p>所以可以说，使用 Lisp 是一个实验。我们的假设是，如果我们用 Lisp 编写软件，我们将能够比竞争对手更快地实现功能，并且能够在我们的软件中实现他们无法实现的功能。而且因为 Lisp 是一种高级语言，我们不需要一个庞大的开发团队，所以我们的成本会更低。如果是这样，我们就可以以更低的价格提供更好的产品，并且仍然盈利。最终，我们会赢得所有用户，而我们的竞争对手将一无所获，最终倒闭。不管怎样，这就是我们希望发生的事情。</p><p>What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn’t have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too. </p><p>这个实验的结果如何呢？令人惊讶的是，它成功了。我们最终有了很多竞争对手，大约有二三十家，但他们的软件都无法与我们的竞争。我们有一个所见即所得的在线商店构建器，它运行在服务器上，但感觉就像一个桌面应用程序。我们的竞争对手只有 CGI 脚本。而且我们在功能上总是远远领先于他们。有时，绝望的竞争对手会试图推出我们没有的功能。但由于 Lisp，我们的开发周期非常快，以至于有时在竞争对手在新闻发布会上宣布新功能后的一两天内，我们就能复制该功能。当报道新闻发布会的记者打电话给我们时，我们也已经有了这个新功能。</p><p>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon– that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible. </p><p>在我们的竞争对手看来，我们一定有某种秘密武器，就好像我们在破解他们的恩尼格玛密码之类的。事实上，我们确实有一个秘密武器，但它比他们意识到的要简单。没有人向我们泄露他们的功能信息。我们只是能够以比任何人想象的都要快的速度开发软件。</p><p>When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth. The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president’s route. He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him. </p><p>我大约九岁的时候，偶然读到了弗雷德里克・福赛斯的《豺狼的日子》。书中的主角是一名受雇刺杀法国总统的刺客。刺客必须避开警察，到达一个可以俯瞰总统行进路线的公寓。他装扮成一个拄着拐杖的老人从警察身边走过，警察从未怀疑过他。</p><p>Our secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But now it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don’t understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force. </p><p>我们的秘密武器与此类似。我们用一种奇怪的人工智能语言编写软件，它有着充满括号的怪异语法。多年来，听到 Lisp 被那样描述一直让我很恼火。但现在，这却对我们有利。在商业中，没有什么比你的竞争对手不理解的技术优势更有价值了。在商业中，就像在战争中一样，出其不意与力量同样重要。</p><p>And so, I’m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb. We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you’d find were the titles of two books in my bio. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn’t know what language our software was written in, or didn’t care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2] </p><p>所以，有点尴尬的是，在我们开发 Viaweb 的过程中，我从未公开谈论过 Lisp。我们从未向媒体提及过它，如果你在我们的网站上搜索 Lisp，你只会在我的个人简介中找到两本书的书名。这并非偶然。初创公司应该尽可能少地向竞争对手透露信息。如果他们不知道我们的软件是用什么语言编写的，或者他们不在乎，我希望保持这种状态。[2]</p><p>The people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn’t care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got more and more users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we had 500. Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market. It’s one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping. I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don’t know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000. </p><p>最了解我们技术的人是客户。他们也不在乎 Viaweb 是用什么语言编写的，但他们注意到它运行得非常好。它让他们能够在几分钟内就构建出漂亮的在线商店。所以，主要是通过口口相传，我们获得了越来越多的用户。到 1996 年底，我们大约有 70 家在线商店。到 1997 年底，我们有了 500 家。六个月后，当雅虎收购我们时，我们有 1070 个用户。如今，作为雅虎商店，这款软件继续主导着它所在的市场。它是雅虎最赚钱的产品之一，用它构建的商店是雅虎购物的基础。我在 1999 年离开了雅虎，所以我不知道现在他们具体有多少用户，但我最后一次听说时大约有 20000 个。</p><p>The Blub Paradox </p><p>What’s so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn’t everyone use it? These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn’t use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. Of course, both these answers need explaining. </p><p><strong>Blub悖论</strong></p><p>Lisp 到底好在哪里呢？如果 Lisp 这么好，为什么不是每个人都使用它呢？这些听起来像是反问句，但实际上它们有直接的答案。Lisp 之所以好，并不是因为只有其爱好者才能看到的某种神奇特质，而是因为它确实是目前最强大的语言。而不是每个人都使用它的原因是，编程语言不仅仅是技术，也是思维习惯，而没有什么比思维习惯更难改变的了。当然，这两个答案都需要解释。</p><p>I’ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power. </p><p>我将从一个极具争议性的陈述开始：编程语言的能力是有差异的。</p><p>Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers. </p><p>至少，很少有人会质疑高级语言比机器语言更强大。如今，大多数程序员都会同意，通常情况下，你不想用机器语言编程。相反，你应该用高级语言编程，然后让编译器将其翻译成机器语言。这个想法现在甚至已经融入了硬件设计中：自 20 世纪 80 年代以来，指令集就是为编译器而不是人类程序员设计的。</p><p>Everyone knows it’s a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. What’s less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3] </p><p>每个人都知道，手工用机器语言编写整个程序是错误的。但人们较少理解的是，这里有一个更普遍的原则：如果你有几种语言可供选择，在其他条件相同的情况下，不使用最强大的语言编程是错误的。[3]</p><p>There are many exceptions to this rule. If you’re writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. If you’re writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster. And if you’re writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task. But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language. </p><p>这个规则有很多例外情况。如果你编写的程序必须与用某种特定语言编写的程序紧密协作，那么用相同的语言编写新程序可能是个好主意。如果你编写的程序只需要做一些非常简单的事情，比如数值运算或位操作，那么你不妨使用一种抽象程度较低的语言，尤其是因为它可能会稍微快一些。如果你编写的是一个简短的、一次性的程序，那么使用对该任务有最佳库函数的语言可能会更好。但一般来说，对于应用软件，你应该使用你能找到的最强大（且效率合理）的语言，使用其他语言是错误的，这与用机器语言编程是同一类错误，只是程度可能较轻。</p><p>You can see that machine language is very low level. But, at least as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all treated as equivalent. They’re not. Technically the term “high-level language” doesn’t mean anything very definite. There’s no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power. </p><p>你可以看到，机器语言是非常低级的。但至少作为一种社会惯例，高级语言通常都被视为是等效的。其实不然。从技术上讲，“高级语言” 这个术语并没有非常明确的含义。在机器语言和所有高级语言之间并没有一条明确的分界线。语言沿着抽象程度的连续体分布，从最强大的语言一直到机器语言，而机器语言本身的能力也有差异。[4]</p><p>Consider Cobol. </p><p>Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that it gets compiled into machine language. Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python? It’s probably closer to machine language than Python. </p><p>以 Cobol 为例。Cobol 是一种高级语言，因为它会被编译成机器语言。有人会认真地认为 Cobol 在能力上与 Python 相当吗？它可能比 Python 更接近机器语言。</p><p>Or how about Perl 4? Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language. Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl 5 is more powerful than Perl 4. But once you’ve admitted that, you’ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get. </p><p>那么 Perl 4 呢？在 Perl 4 和 Perl 5 之间，语言中添加了词法闭包。大多数 Perl 黑客会同意 Perl 5 比 Perl 4 更强大。但一旦你承认了这一点，你就承认了一种高级语言可以比另一种更强大。因此，除了特殊情况，你应该使用你能得到的最强大的语言，这是必然的结论。</p><p>This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though. After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough. </p><p>然而，这个想法很少有人贯彻到底。在某个年龄之后，程序员很少会自愿更换语言。人们往往认为自己习惯使用的任何语言就足够好了。</p><p>Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, so to explain this point I’m going to use a hypothetical language called Blub. Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language. </p><p>程序员非常喜欢他们喜欢的语言，我不想伤害任何人的感情，所以为了解释这一点，我将使用一种假设的语言，叫做 Blub。Blub 正好处于抽象程度连续体的中间。它不是最强大的语言，但它比 Cobol 或机器语言更强大。</p><p>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn’t use either of them. Of course he wouldn’t program in machine language. That’s what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn’t know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn’t even have x (Blub feature of your choice). </p><p>事实上，我们假设的 Blub 程序员不会使用这两种语言。当然，他不会用机器语言编程。那是编译器该做的事。至于 Cobol，他不知道人们怎么能用它完成任何事情。它甚至没有 x（你选择的 Blub 特性）。</p><p>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he’s looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they’re missing some feature he’s used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn’t realize he’s looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub. </p><p>(注：power continuum暂时无法直译 老实说作者举这个例子根本就是一个败笔，没有把事情讲清楚反而引发了一堆误会。简言之：低维生物无法理解高维生物。)</p><p>只要我们假设的 Blub 程序员向下看能力连续体，他就知道自己在向下看。比 Blub 能力更弱的语言显然更弱，因为它们缺少他习惯使用的某些特性。但当我们假设的 Blub 程序员向另一个方向看，即向上看能力连续体时，他没有意识到自己在向上看。他看到的只是奇怪的语言。他可能认为它们在能力上与 Blub 相当，只是还包含了其他一些难以理解的东西。Blub 对他来说已经足够好了，因为他是用 Blub 来思考的。</p><p>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn’t even have y. </p><p>然而，当我们转换到使用能力连续体中更高级语言的程序员的视角时，我们会发现，他反过来会看不起 Blub。你怎么能用 Blub 完成任何事情呢？它甚至没有 y。</p><p>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can’t trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they’re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs. </p><p>通过归纳法可知，只有理解最强大语言的程序员才能看到各种语言之间能力的所有差异。（这可能就是埃里克・雷蒙德所说的 Lisp 能让你成为更好的程序员的意思。）你不能相信其他人的观点，因为存在 Blub 悖论：他们对自己碰巧使用的任何语言都感到满意，因为这种语言决定了他们思考程序的方式。</p><p>I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing programs in Basic. That language didn’t even support recursion. It’s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but I didn’t miss it at the time. I thought in Basic. And I was a whiz at it. Master of all I surveyed. </p><p>我从自己的经历中知道这一点，我在高中时用 Basic 编程。那种语言甚至不支持递归。很难想象不使用递归编写程序，但我当时并不觉得缺少什么。我是用 Basic 来思考的。而且我在这方面很出色。我是我所涉足领域的大师。</p><p>The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I’ll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? [5] </p><p>埃里克・雷蒙德推荐给黑客的五种语言处于能力连续体的不同位置。它们相对位置如何是一个敏感话题。我想说的是，我认为 Lisp 处于顶端。为了支持这一说法，我会告诉你，当我看其他四种语言时，我发现它们缺少的东西之一。我想，如果没有宏，怎么能用它们完成任何事情呢？</p><p>Many languages have something called a macro. But Lisp macros are unique. And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses. The designers of Lisp didn’t put all those parentheses in the language just to be different. To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. But those parentheses are there for a reason. They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between Lisp and other languages. </p><p>很多语言都有叫做宏的东西。但 Lisp 的宏是独特的。信不信由你，它们的功能与括号有关。Lisp 的设计者在语言中使用那么多括号并不是为了与众不同。对于 Blub 程序员来说，Lisp 代码看起来很奇怪。但这些括号是有原因的。它们是 Lisp 与其他语言根本区别的外在表现。</p><p>Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. Lisp code, after it’s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse. </p><p>Lisp 代码是由 Lisp 数据对象组成的。这并不是说源文件包含字符，而字符串是语言支持的数据类型之一这种简单的意义。Lisp 代码在被解析器读取后，是由你可以遍历的数据结构组成的。</p><p>If you understand how compilers work, what’s really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these programs are called macros. They are programs that write programs. </p><p>如果你了解编译器的工作原理，那么实际情况与其说是 Lisp 有奇怪的语法，不如说是 Lisp 没有语法。你在用其他语言解析时在编译器中生成的解析树来编写程序。但这些解析树对你的程序是完全可访问的。你可以编写程序来操作它们。在 Lisp 中，这些程序被称为宏。它们是编写程序的程序。</p><p>Programs that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that? But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn’t know Lisp; there isn’t room here to explain everything you’d need to know to understand what it meant. In Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn’t get to macros until page 160. </p><p>编写程序的程序？你什么时候会想这样做呢？如果你用 Cobol 思考，这种情况很少会出现。但如果你用 Lisp 思考，这种情况会一直出现。如果我能在这里举一个强大宏的例子，然后说 “看！怎么样？”，那会很方便。但如果我这样做了，对于不懂 Lisp 的人来说，这看起来就像是胡言乱语；这里没有足够的空间来解释理解它所需的所有知识。在《ANSI Common Lisp》这本书中，我尽可能快地介绍内容，但即便如此，我直到第 160 页才讲到宏。</p><p>But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it’s considered to be bad style to use them when they’re not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can’t easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him curious. We weren’t writing this code for our own amusement. We were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to put technical barriers between us and our competitors. </p><p>但我想我可以给出一种可能有说服力的论据。Viaweb 编辑器的源代码中可能大约有 20%-25% 是宏。宏比普通的 Lisp 函数更难编写，而且在不必要的时候使用宏被认为是不好的风格。所以那段代码中的每个宏都是必不可少的。这意味着这个程序中至少有 20%-25% 的代码在做其他任何语言都不容易做到的事情。无论 Blub 程序员对我所说的 Lisp 的神秘力量有多么怀疑，这都应该让他感到好奇。我们编写这段代码不是为了自娱自乐。我们是一家小型初创公司，尽可能努力地编程，以便在我们和竞争对手之间设置技术障碍。</p><p>A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some correlation here. A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors’ software couldn’t do. Maybe there was some kind of connection. I encourage you to follow that thread. There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches than meets the eye. </p><p>一个多疑的人可能会开始怀疑这里是否存在某种关联。我们的很大一部分代码在做其他语言很难做到的事情。最终得到的软件能实现我们竞争对手的软件无法实现的功能。也许这之间存在某种联系。我鼓励你顺着这条线索思考。那个拄着拐杖蹒跚而行的老人可能有更多不为人知的秘密。</p><p>Aikido for Startups </p><p>But I don’t expect to convince anyone (over 25) to go out and learn Lisp. The purpose of this article is not to change anyone’s mind, but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp– people who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it isn’t widely used. In a competitive situation, that’s an advantage. Lisp’s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don’t get it. </p><p>但我并不期望说服任何（25 岁以上的）人去学习 Lisp。本文的目的不是为了改变任何人的想法，而是为了让已经对使用 Lisp 感兴趣的人放心 —— 这些人知道 Lisp 是一种强大的语言，但因为它没有被广泛使用而感到担忧。在竞争环境中，这是一种优势。Lisp 的力量因你的竞争对手不理解它而被放大。</p><p>If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn’t worry that it isn’t widely understood. You should hope that it stays that way. And it’s likely to. It’s the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use. Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the processor. At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. I bet a lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor, like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them out by switching to a risc instruction set. </p><p>如果你考虑在初创公司使用 Lisp，不必担心它未被广泛理解。你反而应该希望它保持这种状态 —— 而且这很可能成真。编程语言的本质是，大多数人会满足于自己当前使用的语言。计算机硬件的变化速度远超人类习惯的改变，因此编程实践通常比处理器的发展落后 10 到 20 年。早在 20 世纪 60 年代初，麻省理工学院（MIT）等地就已开始用高级语言编程，但许多公司直到 80 年代仍在使用机器语言写代码。我敢说，不少人坚持用机器语言编程，直到处理器像急于打烊的酒保一样，通过转向 RISC 指令集最终把他们 “赶出去”。</p><p>Ordinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They’re half technology and half religion.[6] </p><p>通常来说，技术变化很快。但编程语言不同：它们不仅是技术，更是程序员的思维载体。它们一半是技术，一半是信仰。</p><p>And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg. Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen. Macros, introduced by Lisp in the mid 1960s, are still terra incognita. </p><p>因此，“中位数语言”—— 即大多数程序员使用的语言 —— 像冰山一样移动缓慢。Lisp 在 1960 年左右引入的垃圾回收机制，如今已被广泛认可为有益功能；同样源自 Lisp 的运行时类型检查，普及率也在上升；20 世纪 70 年代初 Lisp 引入的词法闭包，如今才刚刚进入大众视野；而 60 年代中期 Lisp 提出的宏，至今仍是一片未知领域。</p><p>Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum. I’m not proposing that you can fight this powerful force. What I’m proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents. </p><p>显然，中位数语言具有巨大的惯性。我并非建议你对抗这种强大的力量，恰恰相反：你可以像合气道选手一样，借力打力，用它来对付对手。</p><p>If you work for a big company, this may not be easy. You will have a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over the world. But if you work for a startup that doesn’t have pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub paradox to your advantage: you can use technology that your competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be able to match. </p><p>如果你在大公司工作，这可能不容易。当你那 “地中海发型老板” 刚在报纸上看到某语言（就像 20 年前的 Ada）即将 “统治世界” 时，你很难说服他让你用 Lisp 开发。但如果你在一家还没有 “地中海老板” 的初创公司，就能像我们一样，将 “Blub 悖论” 转化为优势：你可以使用那些被中位数语言牢牢束缚的竞争对手永远无法匹敌的技术。</p><p>If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here’s a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they’ll get the wrong candidates. </p><p>如果你真的在初创公司工作，这里有个评估竞争对手的实用技巧：看他们的招聘信息。他们网站上的其他内容可能都是库存图片或套话，但招聘信息必须明确说明需求，否则会招到不合适的人。</p><p>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening– that’s starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.  </p><p>在开发 Viaweb 的那些年里，我读了很多招聘描述。几乎每个月都会冒出新的竞争对手。查看他们是否有在线演示后，我做的第一件事就是看招聘信息。几年下来，我已经能判断哪些公司值得警惕，哪些不必在意。招聘信息越有 “IT 味”，这家公司的威胁就越小。最安全的是那些要求 “Oracle 经验” 的公司 —— 你永远不必担心他们。如果他们招 C++ 或 Java 开发者，你也很安全。如果他们要 Perl 或 Python 程序员，那就要小心了 —— 这听起来像是一家至少技术层面由真正黑客主导的公司。而如果我看到哪家公司招 Lisp 黑客，那才真的会坐立难安。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl. In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It’s hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code. (See Greenspun’s Tenth Rule.) </p><p>[1] Viaweb 最初分为两部分：用于搭建网站的编辑器（用 Lisp 编写），和处理订单的订单系统（用 C 编写）。第一版以 Lisp 为主，因为订单系统规模很小。后来我们新增了两个模块：用 C 写的图像生成器，和主要用 Perl 写的后台管理工具。2003 年 1 月，雅虎发布了用 C++ 和 Perl 重写的新版编辑器。但很难说这个程序从此就与 Lisp 无关了 —— 因为要把原程序翻译成 C++，他们实际上不得不写一个 Lisp 解释器：据我所知，所有页面生成模板的源代码仍然是 Lisp 代码（参见格林斯潘第十法则）。</p><p>[2] Robert Morris says that I didn’t need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn’t have understood why: “If they were that smart they’d already be programming in Lisp.” </p><p>[2] 罗伯特・莫里斯说，我其实不必保密，因为即便竞争对手知道我们用 Lisp，也不会明白原因：“如果他们足够聪明，早就开始用 Lisp 编程了。”</p><p>[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that’s not the sense of the word programmers care about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.) The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn’t, that probably doesn’t make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B. But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn’t, that’s not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions. </p><p>[3] 从图灵等价的角度看，所有语言的能力相同，但这并非程序员关心的 “能力”。（没人想用图灵机编程。）程序员关注的能力或许无法被形式化定义，但可以这样解释：如果在较弱的语言中实现较强语言的某个特性，必须为此编写一个解释器，那么这个特性就体现了语言能力的差异。例如，语言 A 有移除字符串空格的运算符，而语言 B 没有，这未必说明 A 更强 —— 因为 B 可以用子程序实现；但如果 A 支持递归而 B 不支持，这就很难通过库函数弥补了。</p><p>[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it’s not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order. </p><p>[4] 给技术宅的注：也可能是一个向上收窄的格状结构；重要的不是形状，而是语言能力存在某种 “部分排序” 关系。</p><p>[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters. </p><p>[5] 把宏视为独立特性有点误导。实际上，宏的价值很大程度上依赖于 Lisp 的其他特性，如词法闭包和剩余参数。</p><p>[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they’re really works of anthropology. People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic. But the question is only half a religious one; there is something there worth studying, especially if you want to design new languages. </p><p>[6] 因此，编程语言的比较要么沦为 “宗教战争”，要么像本科教材那样刻意中立，实则成了人类学研究。想保平安或求 tenure 的人会避开这个话题。但这个问题只有一半是 “宗教性” 的 —— 其中有值得研究的内容，尤其是对想设计新语言的人而言。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-I’ve-Learned-from-Users"><a href="#What-I’ve-Learned-from-Users" class="headerlink" title="What I’ve Learned from Users"></a>What I’ve Learned from Users</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/users.html">https://paulgraham.com/users.html</a></p><p>September 2022 </p><p>I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I could give for getting in, per word, was: </p><p>最近，我对 Y Combinator（简称 YC）的申请者说，若论 “每字价值”，能给出的最佳申请建议是：</p><blockquote><p> Explain what you’ve learned from users. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>解释你从用户身上学到了什么。</strong></p></blockquote><p>That tests a lot of things: whether you’re paying attention to users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need what you’re making. </p><p>这句话能检验出很多东西：你是否关注用户、对用户的理解有多深，甚至用户对你所做产品的需求有多迫切。</p><p>Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned from YC’s users, the startups we’ve funded? </p><p>之后，我问了自己同样的问题：我从 YC 的用户 —— 也就是我们投资的初创公司身上，学到了什么？</p><p>The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it’s surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of what they’re making. Once you’ve advised 100 startups all doing different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven’t seen before. </p><p>首先想到的是，大多数初创公司面临的问题是相似的。没有两家公司的问题完全相同，但无论它们做什么业务，问题的共性之高都令人惊讶。当你为 100 家业务各异的初创公司提供过建议后，几乎不会遇到从未见过的新问题。</p><p>This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn’t know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage investors might never realize this, because later stage investors might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner will get this much experience in the first year or two. </p><p>这一事实正是 YC 能够有效运作的原因之一。但在创办 YC 时，我并不知道这一点。当时我只有几个案例：我们自己的初创公司，以及朋友创办的公司。后来发现，同样的问题会以不同形式反复出现，这让我很意外。许多后期投资者可能永远不会意识到这一点，因为他们整个职业生涯中或许都不会为 100 家初创公司提供建议，但 YC 的合伙人在入职头一两年就能积累这样的经验。</p><p>That’s one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of data. Not just because you’re looking at more companies, but also because more goes wrong. </p><p>这正是投资大量早期公司而非少量后期公司的优势之一：能获得大量数据。不仅因为关注的公司更多，还因为早期公司出的问题更多。</p><p>But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn’t mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula. There’s no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners who know them well. [1] </p><p>但即便（几乎）了解初创公司可能遇到的所有问题，也不意味着可以将咨询流程自动化或简化成公式。与 YC 合伙人的一对一办公时间是无可替代的。每家初创公司都是独特的，这意味着需要由熟悉它们的特定合伙人提供针对性建议。[1]</p><p>We learned that the hard way, in the notorious “batch that broke YC” in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn’t realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn’t know all the companies yet. [2] </p><p>我们是从惨痛经历中明白这一点的 ——2012 年夏天那个 “搞垮了 YC” 的批次。在此之前，我们把合伙人当作一个 “资源池”：当某家初创公司申请办公时间时，会分配给任何合伙人的下一个空闲时段。这意味着每个合伙人都必须了解所有初创公司。这种模式在 60 家公司时还行得通，但当批次规模扩大到 80 家，一切就乱了。创始人可能没意识到有问题，但合伙人却感到困惑和不满，因为批次进行到一半时，他们仍没了解所有公司。[2]</p><p>At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had happened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of course it blew up. </p><p>起初我很困惑：为什么 60 家公司时一切顺利，80 家就出问题了？不过才多了三分之一而已。后来我意识到，我们用的是 “O (n²)” 算法（复杂度随数量平方增长），所以必然会崩溃。</p><p>The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be. </p><p>我们采取的解决办法很经典：将批次拆分成更小的初创公司组，每组由专门的合伙人团队负责。问题就此解决，且沿用至今。但 “搞垮 YC 的批次” 有力地证明了：为初创公司提供咨询必须个性化。</p><p>Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk about some problem, and we’ll discover another much bigger one in the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties they’re having raising money, and after digging into their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still haven’t cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out to be that their product isn’t good enough. There have been times when I’ve asked “Would you use this yourself, if you hadn’t built it?” and the founders, on thinking about it, said “No.” Well, there’s the reason you’re having trouble getting users. </p><p>另一个相关的意外发现是：创始人往往看不清自己的问题所在。有时他们来讨论某个问题，我们却在交谈中发现了一个严重得多的问题。比如（这种情况太常见了），创始人来谈融资困难，深入了解后却发现，原因是公司业务表现不佳，而投资者一眼就能看穿。又或者，他们担心用户获取难题，实则是产品不够好。有好几次，我问：“如果这不是你自己做的，你会用吗？” 创始人想了想回答 “不会”—— 这就是用户获取难的原因。</p><p>Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative importance. [3] </p><p>通常，创始人知道自己有哪些问题，但分不清它们的重要性。[3] </p><p>They’ll come in to talk about three problems they’re worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn’t matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn’t addressed immediately. It’s like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that’s mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it’s rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are. </p><p>他们可能带着三个担忧来咨询：一个中等重要，一个完全无关紧要，还有一个若不立即解决就会置公司于死地。这就像恐怖电影里的场景：女主角为男友出轨而崩溃，却对神秘敞开的门只略感好奇。你真想对她说：别管男友了，看看那扇门！好在办公时间里，我们可以直接点出来。因此，尽管初创公司仍会倒闭，但很少是因为 “误入有凶手的房间”——YC 合伙人会提醒他们哪里有 “凶手”。</p><p>Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don’t listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting to see the pattern. “They come back a year later,” she said, “and say ‘We wish we’d listened to you.’” </p><p>但问题是，创始人未必会听。这是另一个令人惊讶的发现：他们常常不听我们的建议。几周前，一位共事了几个批次的合伙人跟我说，她发现了一个规律：“一年后，他们会回来对我说‘真该听你的’。”</p><p>It took me a long time to figure out why founders don’t listen. At first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That’s part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is that so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don’t listen to us is that they don’t believe us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise. [4] </p><p>我花了很久才弄明白创始人不听建议的原因。起初以为是固执，这确实是部分原因，但更重要的是，初创公司的很多事都违背直觉。当你告诉别人一件反直觉的事，在他们听来就是错的。所以，创始人不听建议，是因为不相信 —— 至少在亲身经历证明我们是对的之前不相信。[4]</p><p>The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they’re so different from most people’s other experiences. No one knows what it’s like except those who’ve done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren’t counterintuitive, founders wouldn’t need our advice about how to do it. </p><p>初创公司之所以反直觉，是因为它们与大多数人的其他经历截然不同。只有亲身经历过的人才懂。这也是为什么 YC 合伙人通常自己也做过创始人。但奇妙的是，这种反直觉恰恰是 YC 能发挥作用的另一个原因：如果一切都符合直觉，创始人就不需要我们的建议了。</p><p>Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don’t have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don’t matter, there’s no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results. </p><p>专注对早期初创公司尤为重要，因为它们不仅有上百个问题，还没人能分担 —— 只能靠创始人自己。如果创始人专注于无关紧要的事，就没人去管真正重要的事了。因此，YC 的核心工作是：找出最关键的问题，想出解决办法（最好能在一周内见效），然后尝试并衡量效果。重点是行动，以及可衡量的短期结果。</p><p>This doesn’t imply that founders should rush forward regardless of the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there’s less backtracking than you might expect. Founders usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because they’ll talk about the results at office hours the next week. [5] </p><p>这并不意味着创始人应该不顾后果地贸然行动。如果能高频调整方向，就能在微观层面果断决策，同时在宏观层面保持试探。结果可能是一条曲折的路，但推进速度极快，就像橄榄球跑卫带球冲阵的路线。实际上，回头路比想象中少：创始人通常能猜对方向，尤其是在有 YC 合伙人这样的过来人帮他们验证假设的情况下。即便猜错了，也能很快发现 —— 因为下周的办公时间他们就要汇报结果了。[5]</p><p>A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you’re more certain it’s the right one. That’s where a lot of YC’s value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes startups more startup-like. </p><p>导航能力的微小提升能大幅加快速度，原因有二：路径更短，且在确定方向正确时能跑得更快。这正是 YC 的核心价值之一：帮助创始人多一分专注，从而加速前进。而既然速度是初创公司的核心，YC 实际上是让初创公司更 “初创”。</p><p>Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus. </p><p>速度定义初创公司，专注成就速度，YC 提升专注。</p><p>Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what “it” is. Partly because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by hacking the test instead of actually doing whatever it’s supposed to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still see them reverting to their old habits.) </p><p>创始人为何不确定该做什么？部分原因是，初创公司本质上在做新事，没人知道该怎么做，甚至多数时候连 “要做的事到底是什么” 都不清楚。另一部分原因是，初创公司本身就充满反直觉的事。还有一部分原因是，许多创始人 —— 尤其是年轻且有野心的 —— 被训练成了 “为考试而投机” 而非 “为目标而行动”。我花了好几年才意识到这一点。多数国家的教育体系训练人通过 “钻考试空子” 获胜，而非真正做好考试本应衡量的事。但在初创公司里，这一套行不通了。因此，YC 的部分工作是重新训练创始人：别再试图 “钻空子”（这需要的时间长得惊人，一年后仍能看到他们重拾旧习）。</p><p>YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It’s more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It wouldn’t be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn’t be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That’s why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach. </p><p>YC 不只是有经验的创始人传授知识，更像是 “专业化分工” 而非 “学徒制”。YC 合伙人与创始人的知识结构不同：创始人没必要像 YC 合伙人那样掌握关于初创公司问题的百科全书式知识，就像 YC 合伙人也没必要拥有创始人那样深厚的领域知识。这也是为什么即使是有经验的创始人，参加 YC 也仍有价值 —— 就像有经验的运动员也需要教练。</p><p>The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may be even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at history, great work clusters around certain places and institutions: Florence in the late 15th century, the University of Göttingen in the late 19th, The New Yorker under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC. However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else, because they’re so starved for them in everyday life. </p><p>YC 给创始人的另一大财富是同伴，这可能比合伙人的建议更重要。纵观历史，伟大的成就往往扎堆出现在特定地点和机构：15 世纪末的佛罗伦萨、19 世纪末的哥廷根大学、罗斯执掌的《纽约客》、贝尔实验室、施乐 PARC。无论你多优秀，优秀的同伴都能让你更出色。事实上，有远大抱负的人或许最需要同伴，因为日常生活中很难找到同类。</p><p>Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those famous clusters, it won’t be for lack of trying. We were very aware of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be one. By this point it’s not bragging to say that it’s the biggest cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC concede that. </p><p>无论 YC 未来能否跻身这些著名 “集群” 之列，我们都在努力。我们深知这种历史现象，因此在设计 YC 时就刻意朝这个方向努力。如今可以毫不夸张地说，这里聚集了最多优秀的初创公司创始人 —— 就连批评 YC 的人也不得不承认这一点。</p><p>Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you’d expect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn’t be combined — that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup. </p><p>在 YC 之前，人们即便想到这个问题，也大多认为 “同伴” 与 “初创公司” 不可兼得 —— 孤独是独立创业的代价。20 世纪 90 年代，我们在波士顿创办自己的初创公司时就是这种感受：能咨询的前辈寥寥无几（且建议质量参差不齐），却没有同行。没人能一起吐槽投资者的奇葩行为，也没人能一起畅想技术未来。我常对创始人说 “做自己想要的产品”，YC 本身就是如此 —— 它正是我们创业时渴望拥有的东西。</p><p>One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without having to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some places means they’re proportionally absent from the rest. </p><p>我们当时想要的，包括不必挨个找随机的富人就能拿到种子轮融资。如今，这在美国已不算难事。但优秀的同伴永远无法 “批量复制”—— 正因为他们聚集在某些地方，其他地方才会稀缺。</p><p>Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I’ve experienced. We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to talk to. When you have a whole roomful it’s another thing entirely. </p><p>而当同伴真正聚集时，奇迹就会发生。YC 晚宴上的那种活力，是我在别处从未见过的。我们当初能有一两家同行交流就很满足了，而一屋子同行的感觉完全不同。</p><p>YC founders aren’t just inspired by one another. They also help one another. That’s the happiest thing I’ve learned about startup founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it. The result is something far more intense than, say, a university. Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.      </p><p>YC 的创始人不仅相互启发，还彼此帮助。这是我从初创公司创始人身上学到的最令人欣慰的事：他们在帮助同行时能如此慷慨。我们在第一个批次就发现了这一点，并刻意设计 YC 来放大这种精神。结果是，这里的氛围比大学等场所浓烈得多。在合伙人、校友和同批次伙伴的围绕下，创始人身边全是愿意且有能力帮助他们的人。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] This is why I’ve never liked it when people refer to YC as a “bootcamp.” It’s intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in structure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they’re each talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup needs. </p><p>[1] 这也是我不喜欢人们把 YC 称为 “训练营” 的原因。它和训练营一样高强度，但结构完全相反：不是所有人都做同样的事，而是各自与 YC 合伙人沟通，找到自己公司的特定需求。</p><p>[2] When I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt to the partners that something was wrong. Things weren’t yet so broken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch did unusually well. </p><p>[2] 我说 2012 年夏天的批次 “垮了”，是指合伙人觉得有问题。当时还没到影响初创公司体验的地步，事实上那个批次的表现异常好。</p><p>[3] This situation reminds me of the research showing that people are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how accurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar. </p><p>[3] 这种情况让我想到一项研究：人们回答问题的能力，远好于判断自己答案准确性的能力。这两种现象很相似。</p><p>[4] The Airbnbs were particularly good at listening — partly because they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they’d had such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready to listen. </p><p>[4] Airbnb 的创始人尤其善于倾听 —— 部分因为他们灵活且自律，也因为前一年经历了太多困境，他们已经做好了倾听的准备。</p><p>[5] The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you’re solving. When you’re negotiating with investors, it could be a couple days, whereas if you’re building hardware it could be months.  Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.</p><p>[5] 决策的最佳周期取决于获得结果的时间，而这又取决于问题类型。与投资者谈判可能需要几天，而硬件研发可能需要几个月。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Bus-Ticket-Theory-of-Genius"><a href="#The-Bus-Ticket-Theory-of-Genius" class="headerlink" title="The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius"></a>The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/genius.html">https://paulgraham.com/genius.html</a></p><p>November 2019 </p><p>(注：原文直译 The Bus Ticket Theory 为公交车票理论，意指美国有人喜欢不带功利主义的收集不同种类的车票，但国内其实没有这种公交车票，故标题改为集邮理论比较贴切。)</p><p>Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and determination. But there’s a third ingredient that’s not as well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. </p><p>众所周知，要做出伟大的成就，既需要天赋，也需要决心。但还有第三个要素，其重要性却鲜为人知：对某个特定领域近乎痴迷的兴趣。</p><p>To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group of people, and I’m going to choose bus ticket collectors. There are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect. They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember. Because we don’t care enough. What’s the point of spending so much time thinking about old bus tickets? </p><p>要解释这一点，我可能得得罪一部分人 —— 我选择拿公交车票收集者开刀。有些人会收集旧公交车票。和许多收藏者一样，他们会痴迷于所藏物品的细枝末节。他们能分辨出不同公交车票之间的细微差别，而这些差别对我们其他人来说，可能很难记住。因为我们没那么在乎。花这么多时间琢磨旧公交车票，有什么意义呢？</p><p>Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession: there is no point. A bus ticket collector’s love is disinterested. They’re not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but for its own sake. </p><p>这就引出了这种痴迷的第二个特点：它本身没有 “意义”。公交车票收集者的热爱是不带功利心的。他们这么做不是为了给我们留下深刻印象，也不是为了发财，而是单纯因为热爱。</p><p>When you look at the lives of people who’ve done great work, you see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector’s obsessive interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin’s book about his voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on his slate what happens to series. </p><p>纵观那些做出伟大成就的人的生平，你会发现一个一致的模式：他们往往始于一种类似 “公交车票收集者” 的痴迷 —— 痴迷于某件在同时代大多数人看来毫无意义的事。达尔文在《贝格尔号航行记》中，对自然史的兴趣之深令人惊叹，他的好奇心仿佛无穷无尽。拉马努金也是如此，他会一连几个小时坐在石板前，演算级数的变化。</p><p>It’s a mistake to think they were “laying the groundwork” for the discoveries they made later. There’s too much intention in that metaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it because they liked it. </p><p>认为他们是在为后来的发现 “奠定基础”，这是一种误解。这个比喻里包含了太多 “刻意”。就像公交车票收集者一样，他们做这些事，只是因为喜欢。</p><p>But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket collector. Series matter, and bus tickets don’t. </p><p>但拉马努金和公交车票收集者之间有一个区别：级数是重要的，而公交车票不是。</p><p>If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters. </p><p>如果非要用一句话概括天才的秘诀，或许是：对某个重要的事物抱有不带功利心的痴迷。</p><p>Aren’t I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won’t find series interesting. And when you’re obsessively interested in something, you don’t need as much determination: you don’t need to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you. </p><p>我是不是忽略了另外两个要素？其实没有你想的那么严重。对一个领域的痴迷，既是能力的体现，也能替代决心。除非你有足够的数学天赋，否则你不会觉得级数有趣。而当你痴迷于某件事时，你就不需要那么多决心了：当好奇心在 “拉着” 你时，你就不用费那么大劲 “推” 自己了。</p><p>An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent anything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind, and if there’s one thing an obsessed mind is, it’s prepared. </p><p>这种痴迷甚至能给你带来运气 —— 如果说 “运气” 真的存在的话。正如巴斯德所说，机遇偏爱有准备的头脑，而痴迷的头脑，无疑是 “有准备” 的。</p><p>The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important feature. Not just because it’s a filter for earnestness, but because it helps you discover new ideas. </p><p>这种痴迷的 “非功利性” 是其最重要的特点。不仅因为它能筛选出真正的热忱，更因为它能帮你发现新想法。</p><p>The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they looked promising, other people would already have explored them. How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others overlook? The popular story is that they simply have better vision: because they’re so talented, they see paths that others miss. But if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that’s not what happens. Darwin didn’t pay closer attention to individual species than other people because he saw that this would lead to great discoveries, and they didn’t. He was just really, really interested in such things. </p><p>通往新想法的道路，往往看起来毫无前景。如果它们看起来前途光明，其他人早就去探索了。那些做出伟大成就的人，是如何发现这些被他人忽视的道路的？人们普遍认为，他们只是视力更好：因为天赋异禀，所以能看到别人看不到的路。但如果你仔细观察伟大发现的诞生过程，就会发现事实并非如此。达尔文对单个物种的关注比其他人更密切，不是因为他预见到这会带来伟大的发现，而别人没预见到 —— 他只是真的对这些东西非常非常感兴趣。</p><p>Darwin couldn’t turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan. They didn’t discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising, but because they couldn’t help it. That’s what allowed them to follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have ignored. </p><p>达尔文无法停止这种兴趣，拉马努金也一样。他们发现那些被隐藏的道路，不是因为这些路看起来有前景，而是因为他们忍不住。这正是他们能沿着那些 “仅仅有野心的人” 会忽略的道路走下去的原因。</p><p>What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels was to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope. </p><p>哪个理性的人会决定，写伟大的小说要从花几年时间创造一种虚构的精灵语开始（比如托尔金），或者去拜访英国西南部的每一户人家（比如特罗洛普）？没人会，包括托尔金和特罗洛普自己。</p><p>The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle’s famous definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence, as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters. </p><p>这个 “公交车票理论” 有点像卡莱尔对天才的著名定义 ——“无穷的吃苦耐劳能力”。但两者有两个区别。公交车票理论明确指出，这种 “无穷的吃苦耐劳能力” 的源头，并非卡莱尔所暗示的 “无穷的勤奋”，而是收藏者那种 “无穷的兴趣”；此外，它还加了一个重要限定：这种 “无穷的吃苦耐劳” 要针对 “重要的事物”。</p><p>So what matters? You can never be sure. It’s precisely because no one can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can discover new ideas by working on what you’re interested in. </p><p>那么，什么是 “重要的事物”？你永远无法确定。正因为没人能提前知道哪些道路有前景，你才能通过钻研自己感兴趣的事，发现新想法。</p><p>But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might be one that matters. For example, it’s more promising if you’re creating something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It’s more promising if something you’re interested in is difficult, especially if it’s more difficult for other people than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become interested in random things, they’re not truly random. </p><p>但有一些方法可以帮你猜测一种痴迷是否可能 “重要”。比如，如果你在 “创造” 某样东西，而不是仅仅 “消费” 别人创造的东西，这种痴迷更有前景；如果你感兴趣的事很难，尤其是对别人比对你更难，这种痴迷更有前景；有天赋的人的痴迷，也更可能有前景 —— 当有天赋的人对 “随机的事” 产生兴趣时，这些事往往并非真的随机。</p><p>But you can never be sure. In fact, here’s an interesting idea that’s also rather alarming if it’s true: it may be that to do great work, you also have to waste a lot of time. </p><p>但你永远无法完全确定。事实上，有一个有趣但可能令人不安的想法：要做出伟大的成就，或许你也得浪费很多时间。</p><p>In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem. </p><p>在很多领域，回报与风险成正比。如果这个规律在这里也成立，那么找到能通向伟大成就的道路的方法，就是愿意在那些看起来毫无前景的事情上投入大量精力。</p><p>I’m not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly difficult to waste your time so long as you’re working hard on something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful. But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk and reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs. Newton’s case, at least, suggests that the risk&#x2F;reward rule holds here. He’s famous for one particular obsession of his that turned out to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the world. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that seem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead. His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more than compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary, in the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big discoveries? I don’t know. </p><p>我不确定这是否正确。一方面，只要你在努力钻研自己感兴趣的事，似乎就很难 “浪费时间”—— 你做的很多事最终都会派上用场。但另一方面，风险与回报的规律如此强大，似乎在所有存在风险的领域都成立。至少牛顿的例子说明，这个规律在这里是成立的。他因对 “用数学描述世界” 的痴迷而闻名，这种痴迷的成果前所未有；但他还有另外两个痴迷 —— 炼金术和神学，它们似乎完全是浪费时间。最终他是 “净赚” 的：他在我们如今所说的 “物理学” 上的投入，回报之高足以弥补另外两个领域的 “亏损”。但问题是，另外两个 “亏损” 是否有必要？也就是说，他是否必须冒巨大的风险，才能有巨大的发现？我不知道。</p><p>Here’s an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets? It probably happens quite often. But we don’t know how often, because these people don’t become famous. </p><p>还有一个更令人不安的想法：会不会有人所有的 “赌注” 都下错了？这可能经常发生。但我们不知道有多频繁，因为这些人不会出名。</p><p>It’s not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to predict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good time to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had been born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of him. </p><p>不仅回报难以预测，其本身还会随时间发生巨大变化。1830 年是痴迷自然史的黄金时代。如果达尔文出生在 1709 年而不是 1809 年，我们可能永远不会听说他。</p><p>What can one do in the face of such uncertainty? One solution is to hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with any hedge, you’re decreasing reward when you decrease risk. If you forgo working on what you like in order to follow some more conventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful that you’d otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the time, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail. </p><p>面对这种不确定性，人能做些什么？一种办法是 “对冲赌注”—— 也就是选择那些明显有前景的道路，而非自己私人的痴迷。但就像所有对冲行为一样，降低风险的同时，你也降低了回报。如果你放弃钻研自己喜欢的事，转而去追随那些被同行公认 “有前景” 的道路，你可能会错过那些本可以发现的精彩。这种情况肯定也经常发生，甚至比 “天才押错赌注” 更常见。</p><p>The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of different things. You don’t decrease your upside if you switch between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many different projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of them. </p><p>另一种办法是让自己对很多不同的事感兴趣。如果你能在几个同样真诚的兴趣之间切换（根据哪一个目前看起来更有进展），你的 “上限” 不会降低。但这里也有风险：如果同时做太多不同的项目，你可能在任何一个项目上都无法钻研得足够深。</p><p>One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may help explain why different types of people excel at different kinds of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability. If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in different things. </p><p>“公交车票理论” 的一个有趣之处在于，它或许能解释为什么不同的人擅长不同的工作。兴趣的分布比能力的分布更不均衡。如果说 “只要有天赋就能做出伟大成就”，而天赋的分布是均衡的，那么我们就必须编造复杂的理论来解释：为什么在各个领域做出伟大成就的人，其分布如此不均？但或许，这种不均有一个更简单的解释：不同的人对不同的事感兴趣。</p><p>The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to do great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete not just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and one that for most people is extremely powerful. It’s harder to find time for work after you have kids, but that’s the easy part. The real change is that you don’t want to. </p><p>这个理论也能解释为什么人有了孩子之后，就不太可能做出伟大的成就了。这时，兴趣不仅要与外部障碍竞争，还要与另一种兴趣竞争 —— 对大多数人来说，这种兴趣极其强烈。有了孩子后，很难找到时间工作，但这只是简单的部分。真正的变化是：你不想工作了。</p><p>But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that it suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating interest, to cultivate genius. </p><p>但 “公交车票理论” 最令人兴奋的启示是：它指出了培养伟大成就的方法。如果天才的秘诀只是 “天赋 + 努力”，我们能做的就只有祈祷自己天赋异禀，并拼命努力。但如果兴趣是天才的关键要素，那么通过培养兴趣，我们或许就能培养出天才。</p><p>For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests that the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of gritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers agree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try doing something just for fun. And if you’re stuck, that may be the vector along which to break out. </p><p>比如，对于那些极具野心的人来说，“公交车票理论” 暗示：做出伟大成就的方法是 “放松一点”。与其咬紧牙关、兢兢业业地追逐那些被同行一致认为 “最有前景” 的研究方向，不如试着做点纯粹为了好玩的事。如果你陷入瓶颈，这或许就是突破的方向。</p><p>I’ve always liked Hamming’s famous double-barrelled question: what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren’t you working on one of them? It’s a great way to shake yourself up. But it may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask yourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that probably wouldn’t be important but would be really interesting, what would it be? </p><p>我一直很喜欢汉明那个著名的 “双问”：你所在领域最重要的问题是什么？你为什么没在研究其中一个？这是一个很棒的自我警醒的方法。但它可能有点 “过度拟合” 了。或许，问自己另一个问题也同样有用：如果你能休假一年，去做一件可能不重要但真的很有趣的事，那会是什么？</p><p>The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as you get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as they get older is not simply that they’re losing their edge. It may also be because once you become established, you can no longer mess about with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you were young and no one cared what you did. </p><p>“公交车票理论” 还指出了避免随年龄增长而 “停滞” 的方法。人年纪越大，新想法越少，或许不只是因为 “能力衰退”。也可能是因为，一旦你功成名就，就再也不能像年轻时那样，肆无忌惮地摆弄那些 “不务正业的副业” 了 —— 那时没人在乎你做什么。</p><p>The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be hard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up to stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it. And you yourself won’t know for sure that they’re wrong. But it will at least be more fun to work on what you want. </p><p>解决办法很明显：保持 “不务正业”。但这很难，因为你为了延缓衰退而投身的那些看似随机的项目，在外界看来可能正是 “衰退的证据”。你自己也无法确定他们是不是错的。但至少，做自己想做的事会更有趣。</p><p>It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus ticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start with a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized. But I’ve done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their school to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep. </p><p>我们甚至可以培养孩子 “智力上的公交车票收集习惯”。教育的常规思路是：先广泛而浅显地涉猎，再逐渐专业化。但我对自己的孩子反其道而行之。我知道学校会负责 “广泛而浅显” 的部分，所以我会带他们 “深入”。</p><p>When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage them to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep. I don’t do this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want them to feel the joy of learning, and they’re never going to feel that about something I’m making them learn. It has to be something they’re interested in. I’m just following the path of least resistance; depth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of learning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better. </p><p>当他们对某件事产生兴趣 —— 无论多随机 —— 我都会鼓励他们钻得极深、深到像公交车票收集者那样 “离谱”。我这么做不是因为 “公交车票理论”，而是因为我想让他们感受到学习的乐趣。如果是我逼他们学的东西，他们永远不会有这种乐趣。必须是他们自己感兴趣的事。我只是在 “顺水推舟”，而 “深入” 只是副产品。但如果在向他们展示学习乐趣的过程中，顺便培养了他们 “钻研深入” 的能力，那就更好了。</p><p>Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may be the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn about how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels, it’s really still very young if we haven’t nailed something so basic. It’s exciting to think there are still discoveries to make about discovery. If that’s the sort of thing you’re interested in.      </p><p>这会有效果吗？我不知道。但这种不确定性或许是最有趣的一点。关于 “如何做出伟大成就”，我们还有太多要学。人类文明看似悠久，但如果连这么基础的事都没搞明白，那它其实还很年轻。想到 “关于‘发现’本身，还有待发现的东西”，就很令人兴奋 —— 如果你也对这类事感兴趣的话。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point better than bus tickets, but they’re also more popular. It seemed just as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more people by telling them their hobby doesn’t matter. </p><p>[1] 还有其他类型的收藏比公交车票更能说明这个问题，但这些收藏也更受欢迎。与其用那些例子得罪更多人（告诉他们他们的爱好无关紧要），不如用一个没那么贴切的例子。</p><p>[2] I worried a little about using the word “disinterested,” since some people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone who expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a basic word, so I figure they may as well start now. </p><p>[2] 我有点担心用 “disinterested” 这个词，因为有些人会误以为它的意思是 “不感兴趣”。但任何想成为天才的人，都必须知道这个基础词汇的含义，所以我觉得他们不妨从现在开始了解。</p><p>[3] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by people being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and be responsible. Ramanujan’s mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if she hadn’t been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get a job instead of sitting around at home doing math. On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify not getting a job is probably mistaken. </p><p>[3] 想想看，有多少天才的萌芽，是因为有人（或自己）被告知 “别瞎折腾了，正经点” 而被扼杀的。拉马努金的母亲就是一个极大的支持者。试想如果她不是这样呢？如果他的父母逼着他出去找工作，而不是让他坐在家里研究数学呢？不过，要是有人引用上一段来为自己不找工作找借口，那他很可能是错的。</p><p>[4] 1709 Darwin is to time what the Milanese Leonardo is to space. </p><p>[4] 出生在 1709 年的达尔文（与时代错位），就好比出生在米兰的达芬奇（与地域错位）。</p><p>[5] “An infinite capacity for taking pains” is a paraphrase of what Carlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his History of Frederick the Great, was “… it is the fruit of ‘genius’ (which means transcendent capacity of taking trouble, first of all)….” Since the paraphrase seems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it. Carlyle’s History was published in 1858. In 1785 Hérault de Séchelles quoted Buffon as saying “Le génie n’est qu’une plus grande aptitude à la patience.” (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.) </p><p>[5] “无穷的吃苦耐劳能力” 是对卡莱尔原话的 paraphrase（意译 &#x2F; 改写）。他在《腓特烈大帝传》中写道：“…… 这是‘天才’的成果（而天才首先意味着超凡的吃苦耐劳能力）……” 既然这个改写版本已经成了这个观点的代名词，我就沿用了它。卡莱尔的《腓特烈大帝传》出版于 1858 年。1785 年，埃罗・德・塞谢勒引用布丰的话：“Le génie n’est qu’une plus grande aptitude à la patience.”（天才不过是更强的耐心罢了。）</p><p>[6] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself sensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal. It is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During those two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the country with rural letter-carriers. </p><p>[6] 特罗洛普当时在建立邮政路线系统。他自己也意识到了这种追求背后的痴迷：<br>“看着一种热情如何在人身上滋长，是件很有趣的事。那两年，我毕生的志向就是让乡村邮递员遍布全国。”</p><p>Even Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness. After computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend: I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time. </p><p>就连牛顿也偶尔会意识到自己的痴迷程度。在将 π 计算到 15 位小数后，他在给朋友的信中写道：<br>“我不好意思告诉你我把这些计算做到了多少位，因为那时我没别的事可做。”</p><p>Incidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel writes in his excellent biography: One Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan’s research into number theory was often “preceded by a table of numerical results, carried usually to a length from which most of us would shrink.” </p><p>顺便说一句，拉马努金也是个 “计算狂”。卡尼格尔在他那本出色的传记中写道：“拉马努金的研究者 B. M. 威尔逊后来提到，拉马努金对数论的研究，往往‘始于一张数值结果表，其长度通常会让我们大多数人望而却步’。”</p><p>[7] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating rather than consuming. Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose to work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but chasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing down paradoxes in sacred texts is not. </p><p>[7] 努力理解自然世界属于 “创造”，而非 “消费”。牛顿在选择研究神学时，就混淆了这一点。他的信仰让他无法看清：探索自然界中的悖论，与探索宗教文本中的悖论，前者能带来成果，后者则不能。</p><p>[8] How much of people’s propensity to become interested in a topic is inborn? My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of it. Different kids get interested in different things, and it’s hard to make a child interested in something they wouldn’t otherwise be. Not in a way that sticks. The most you can do on behalf of a topic is to make sure it gets a fair showing — to make it clear to them, for example, that there’s more to math than the dull drills they do in school. After that it’s up to the child.</p><p>[8] 人们对某个领域产生兴趣的倾向，有多少是天生的？我的经验告诉我：大部分是。不同的孩子会对不同的事物感兴趣，很难让一个孩子对他本不感兴趣的东西产生兴趣 —— 至少无法让这种兴趣持久。你能为某个领域做的，最多是让它得到公平的展示机会 —— 比如让孩子明白，数学不只是学校里那些枯燥的练习。剩下的，就看孩子自己了。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Work-Hard"><a href="#How-to-Work-Hard" class="headerlink" title="How to Work Hard"></a>How to Work Hard</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html">https://paulgraham.com/hwh.html</a></p><p>June 2021 </p><p>It might not seem there’s much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who’s been to school knows what it entails, even if they chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I was in school, the answer is definitely yes. </p><p>关于如何努力工作，似乎没什么太多可学的。任何上过学的人都知道努力工作意味着什么，即便他们选择不这么做。有些 12 岁的孩子就已经非常努力了。但如果问我现在对努力工作的理解是否比上学时更深，答案无疑是肯定的。</p><p>One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you’ll have to work very hard. I wasn’t sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork varied in difficulty; one didn’t always have to work super hard to do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question. There isn’t. </p><p>我知道的一点是，若想成就伟大的事业，就必须付出极大的努力。小时候我对此并不确定。学校的功课难度不一，有时不必拼尽全力也能做得很好。而且有些知名人士的成就，看似毫不费力就能达成。或许，仅凭过人的天赋就能规避努力工作的必要？如今我有了答案：不能。</p><p>The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy. </p><p>有些科目看似简单，是因为我所在的学校标准太低。而那些知名人士看似轻松的成就，背后是多年的练习 —— 他们只是让一切看起来毫不费力。</p><p>Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability, practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard. [1] </p><p>当然，这些知名人士通常也极具天赋。伟大的成就由三个要素构成：天赋、练习和努力。具备其中两项就能做得不错，但要做到顶尖，三者缺一不可：你需要极高的天赋、大量的练习，以及全力以赴的努力。[1]</p><p>Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. “I never took a day off in my twenties,” he said. “Not one.” It was similar with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote </p><blockquote><p>with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one’s toes and makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases twenty times. </p></blockquote><p>比如比尔・盖茨，他是自己时代商界最聪明的人之一，但也是最努力的人之一。他曾说：“我二十多岁时一天都没休息过，一天都没有。” 莱昂内尔・梅西也是如此。他天赋异禀，但青年时期的教练们回忆起他时，印象最深的不是他的天赋，而是他的专注和求胜欲。如果要我选 20 世纪最优秀的英语作家，P.G. 伍德豪斯或许会是我的答案。没人比他更能让写作看起来轻松，但也没人比他更努力。74 岁时，他写道：</p><blockquote><p>“就像我说的，每写一本新书，我都觉得自己像是在文学的花园里摘了个柠檬。不过或许这是件好事，能让我时刻保持警觉，把每句话改写十遍，很多时候甚至二十遍。”</p></blockquote><p>Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even more extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had about as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both. </p><p>你可能觉得这有点极端，但比尔・盖茨的经历更极端。十年间一天都不休息？这两个人拥有常人难以企及的天赋，却也付出了常人难以想象的努力。两者你都需要。</p><p>That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard to grasp. There’s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less of the other. But you’ll need both if you want to be an outlier yourself. And since you can’t really change how much natural talent you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces to working very hard. </p><p>这道理看似显而易见，但实践中我们却很难完全理解。人们似乎总觉得天赋和努力是 “非此即彼” 的。这种想法部分源于流行文化（其影响根深蒂固），部分源于 “异类” 本身极为罕见。如果极高的天赋和极强的驱动力都很稀有，那么两者兼具的人就更稀有了。你遇到的大多数人，往往在一方面突出，在另一方面就稍显不足。但如果你想成为 “异类”，就必须两者兼具。既然天赋难以改变，那么在实践中，成就伟大的事业（尽你所能）就归结为付出极大的努力。</p><p>It’s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate (which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want it. </p><p>如果目标明确且由外部设定（比如上学时），努力工作就很直接。这需要一些技巧：学会不欺骗自己，不拖延（拖延是欺骗自己的一种形式），不分心，遇到问题不放弃。但只要愿意，即便是小孩子也能达到这种自律水平。</p><p>What I’ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You’ll probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things. </p><p>长大后我才明白，如何为那些既不明确也非外部设定的目标努力。若想成就真正伟大的事业，这两种努力方式你可能都得学会。</p><p>The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working without anyone telling you to. Now, when I’m not working hard, alarm bells go off. I can’t be sure I’m getting anywhere when I’m working hard, but I can be sure I’m getting nowhere when I’m not, and it feels awful. [2] </p><p>最基础的是，即便没人督促，你也能意识到自己应该工作。现在，如果我没在努力工作，警钟就会敲响。我不确定努力时是否一定有进展，但我确定不努力时一定毫无进展，这种感觉糟透了。[2]</p><p>There wasn’t a single point when I learned this. Like most little kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of disgust when I wasn’t achieving anything. The one precisely dateable landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13. </p><p>我并非在某个瞬间领悟到这一点。和大多数孩子一样，我小时候学到新东西或做成事时，会享受成就感。长大后，这种感觉渐渐变成了 “一事无成时的厌恶”。我能明确追溯的一个节点是 13 岁那年，我不再看电视了。</p><p>Several people I’ve talked to remember getting serious about work around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to find idleness distasteful, he said </p><blockquote><p>I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday. </p></blockquote><p>Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense. </p><p>我聊过的几个人都记得，大概在这个年纪开始认真对待工作。当我问帕特里克・科里森何时开始厌恶懒散时，他说：</p><blockquote><p>“大概 13 或 14 岁吧。我清楚记得，当时坐在客厅里，望着窗外，纳闷自己为什么在浪费暑假。”</p></blockquote><p>或许青春期会发生一些变化，这似乎说得通。</p><p>Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about work was probably school, which made work (what they called work) seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire departments that are pointless. </p><p>奇怪的是，认真对待工作的最大障碍或许是学校 —— 学校让 “工作”（他们所谓的工作）显得枯燥又无意义。我必须先明白什么是 “真正的工作”，才能全身心投入。这花了些时间，因为即便是在大学里，很多工作也是无意义的；有些院系甚至完全是摆设。</p><p>But as I learned the shape of real work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they’d been made for each other. I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can love it. </p><p>但当我逐渐了解了真正工作的模样后，我发现自己对工作的渴望与它完美契合，仿佛二者本就为彼此而生。我猜想，大多数人都得先弄明白工作究竟是什么，才可能爱上它。</p><p>Hardy wrote eloquently about this in A Mathematician’s Apology: </p><blockquote><p>I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively. </p></blockquote><p>He didn’t learn what math was really about till part way through college, when he read Jordan’s Cours d’analyse. </p><blockquote><p>I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant. </p></blockquote><p>哈代在《一个数学家的辩白》中精辟地描述过这一点：</p><blockquote><p>“我记得小时候，对数学毫无热情，对数学家的职业想象也毫无崇高感。我只把数学和考试、奖学金联系在一起：我想打败其他男孩，而数学似乎是最有效的方式。” </p></blockquote><p>他直到大学期间读了若尔当的《分析教程》，才明白数学的真谛：</p><blockquote><p>“我永远忘不了读那本杰作时的震撼 —— 那是我第一次明白数学真正的意义，这本书也是我们这一代许多数学家的启蒙。”</p></blockquote><p>There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to discount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind Hardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they’re adapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they’re nothing like the work done by actual practitioners. [3] </p><p>要理解 “真正的工作”，你需要学会忽略两种 “虚假”。一种是哈代在学校遇到的：学科为了适应教学被扭曲，往往扭曲到和从业者的实际工作毫无关系。[3] </p><p>The other kind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types of work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork. </p><p>另一种是某些工作本身固有的虚假 —— 有些工作本质上就是无意义的，顶多算是 “瞎忙”。</p><p>There’s a kind of solidity to real work. It’s not all writing the Principia, but it all feels necessary. That’s a vague criterion, but it’s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of different types. [4] </p><p>真正的工作有一种 “实在感”。并非都像写《自然哲学的数学原理》那样伟大，但都让人觉得 “有必要”。这个标准很模糊，但故意如此，因为它要涵盖太多不同类型的工作。[4]</p><p>Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many hours a day to spend on it. You can’t solve this problem by simply working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there’s a point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline. </p><p>明白真正的工作是什么样之后，你需要知道每天该花多少时间在上面。不能醒着就一直工作，因为很多工作超过某个临界点后，质量就会下降。</p><p>That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person. I’ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits were different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running a startup, I could work all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I’d kept going much longer, I’d probably have needed to take occasional vacations. [5] </p><p>这个临界点因工作类型和个人而异。我做过几种不同的工作，每种的临界点都不同。较难的写作或编程，我一天最多能做 5 小时。而运营初创公司时，我可以一直工作 —— 至少在那三年里是这样；如果再做更久，可能就得偶尔休假了。[5]</p><p>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a sensitivity to the quality of the work you’re doing, and then you’ll notice if it decreases because you’re working too hard. Honesty is critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you’re being lazy, but also when you’re working too hard. And if you think there’s something admirable about working too hard, get that idea out of your head. You’re not merely getting worse results, but getting them because you’re showing off — if not to other people, then to yourself. [6] </p><p>找到临界点的唯一方法是 “越过它”。培养对工作质量的敏感度，你就会注意到是否因过度工作而导致质量下降。诚实在这里至关重要：既要察觉自己是否懒散，也要发现是否工作过度。如果你觉得过度工作很 “可敬”，赶紧丢掉这个想法。你不仅会得到更差的结果，还会因为 “炫耀”（哪怕只是向自己炫耀）而搞砸工作。[6]</p><p>Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process, not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be constantly judging both how hard you’re trying and how well you’re doing. </p><p>找到努力工作的临界点是一个持续的过程，而非一劳永逸。工作难度和你的能力每时每刻都在变化，所以你需要不断判断自己的努力程度和工作状态。</p><p>Trying hard doesn’t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though. There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly typical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I’m starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That’s when I’m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I tend to keep going. </p><p>不过，努力不意味着一直强迫自己工作。或许有人这样做，但我的经历可能更典型：只有在启动项目或遇到阻碍时，才需要偶尔逼自己一把 —— 这时候最容易拖延。但一旦进入状态，就会自然而然地继续下去。</p><p>What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working on Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated at all then, because there was always something that needed doing, and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast by doing it, why wait? [7] Whereas what drives me now, writing essays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days, like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But once I get started on one, I don’t have to push myself to work, because there’s always some error or omission already pushing me. </p><p>支撑我坚持的动力因工作类型而异。运营 Viaweb 时，我被 “失败的恐惧” 驱动：总有事情要做，多做一点就能离失败远一点，何必等呢？[7] 而现在写文章，动力来自 “文章的缺陷”：构思期间我会纠结几天，像狗转圈选窝一样。但一旦开始写，就不用逼自己 —— 总有错误或疏漏在推着我前进。</p><p>I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff at the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the extent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you’ll only be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should always be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling. </p><p>我确实会努力聚焦于重要的话题。很多问题的核心很难，周围是容易的边缘内容。努力工作意味着尽可能瞄准核心。有些日子可能做不到，只能处理边缘内容，但你应该始终朝着核心努力。</p><p>The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at the edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in working on a specific problem, you’ll occasionally have to make big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do. And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the center — toward the most ambitious problems. </p><p>“人生该做什么” 这个更大的问题，也有这样的 “核心”：中心是重要但困难的问题，边缘是次要且容易的。所以除了日常调整具体工作，你偶尔还需要做人生层面的重大调整：选择哪种工作。原则不变：努力工作意味着瞄准核心 —— 最有野心的问题。</p><p>By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current consensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are most important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific fields. If you disagree with it, and you’re right, that could represent a valuable opportunity to do something new. </p><p>不过，“核心” 指的是 “真正的核心”，而非当前共识中的 “核心”。关于 “哪些问题最重要”，共识往往是错的，无论是在整体还是特定领域。如果你不同意共识且正确，那可能是个做新事的好机会。</p><p>The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you discover some ambitious type of work that’s a bargain in the sense of being easier for you than other people, either because of the abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you’ve found to approach it, or simply because you’re more excited about it, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by people who find an easy way to do something hard. </p><p>更有野心的工作通常更难，但不必因此却步。如果你发现某种有野心的工作对你来说更容易 —— 因为你的天赋、新方法，或者仅仅是更感兴趣 —— 那就去做。有些最伟大的成就是由 “找到难事的简单解法” 的人完成的。</p><p>As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out which kind you’re suited for. And that doesn’t just mean figuring out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn’t mean that if you’re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What you’re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even more on your interests. A deep interest in a topic makes people work harder than any amount of discipline can. </p><p>除了理解真正的工作是什么样，你还需要找到适合自己的类型。这不只是看天赋匹配 —— 比如身高 7 英尺未必就得打篮球。适合与否不仅取决于天赋，更可能取决于兴趣。对一个领域的浓厚兴趣，能让人比任何纪律都更努力。</p><p>It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents. There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a subtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later. The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful sources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really interested in x, or do you want to work on it because you’ll make a lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you, or because your parents want you to? [8] </p><p>发现兴趣比发现天赋更难。天赋的类型更少，从小就被评判；而对一个领域的兴趣很微妙，可能二十多岁甚至更晚才成熟，甚至这个领域之前都不存在。此外，你需要排除一些干扰：你真的对 X 感兴趣，还是因为能赚大钱、让人佩服，或者父母希望你做？[8]</p><p>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously from one person to another. That’s one of the most important things I’ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That’s how it works in movies, and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard. </p><p>“找到该做什么” 的难度因人而异，这是我长大后对工作最重要的领悟之一。小时候，我觉得每个人都有 “使命”，只需找到它就行 —— 电影和给孩子看的简化传记都这么说。现实中有时确实如此：有些人小时候就确定方向并坚持，比如莫扎特。但另一些人，比如牛顿，会不安地从一种工作转向另一种。或许回头看我们能认定他的 “使命”（希望他多花时间在数学和物理上，少在炼金术和神学上），但这是后见之明的错觉 —— 他从未听到过所谓的 “召唤”。</p><p>So while some people’s lives converge fast, there will be others whose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what to work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing part of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these people, the process I described earlier has a third component: along with measuring both how hard you’re working and how well you’re doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in this field or switch to another. If you’re working hard but not getting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple expressed that way, but in practice it’s very difficult. You shouldn’t give up on the first day just because you work hard and don’t get anywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much time? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going well? How much time do you give yourself then? [9] </p><p>所以，有些人的人生很快聚焦，有些人则永远不会。对后者来说，“找到该做什么” 不是努力工作的前奏，而是其一部分，就像一组联立方程。这些人需要不断判断：既要衡量努力程度和成果，也要思考是否该换个领域。如果努力了却没好结果，就该换。说起来简单，做起来很难：不能第一天没进展就放弃，需要给时间让自己进入状态。但给多久？如果曾经顺利的工作突然停滞，又该给多久？[9]</p><p>What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide. If you’re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not even know what good results look like. History is full of examples of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working on. </p><p>“什么算好结果” 也很难判断。如果在很少人涉足的领域探索，你可能都不知道好结果是什么样。历史上很多人都误判了自己工作的重要性。</p><p>The best test of whether it’s worthwhile to work on something is whether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously subjective measure, but it’s probably the most accurate one you’re going to get. You’re the one working on the stuff. Who’s in a better position than you to judge whether it’s important, and what’s a better predictor of its importance than whether it’s interesting? </p><p>判断一件事是否值得做，最好的标准是 “你是否觉得它有趣”。这听起来主观，但可能是最准确的。你是做这件事的人，谁比你更适合判断它是否重要？而 “有趣” 往往是 “重要” 的最佳预示。</p><p>For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself. Indeed, that’s the most striking thing about the whole question of working hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with yourself. </p><p>但这需要你对自己诚实。事实上，努力工作的整个问题中，最突出的一点就是：每一步都取决于对自己诚实。</p><p>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It’s a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you’re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you’re capable of and how you’re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you’re consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you’ll be productive in a way few people are.      </p><p>努力工作不是把 “旋钮” 拧到最大。它是一个复杂的动态系统，需要随时调整：你要理解真正的工作是什么样，看清自己最适合哪种，尽可能瞄准其核心，时刻判断自己的能力和状态，每天投入不影响质量的时间。这个系统太复杂，无法欺骗。但如果你始终诚实、清醒，它自然会达到最佳状态，让你拥有少数人才能达到的生产力。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] In “The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius” I said the three ingredients in great work were natural ability, determination, and interest. That’s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest yield practice and effort. </p><p>[1] 在《天才的公交车票理论》中，我说过伟大工作的三个要素是天赋、决心和兴趣。这是前期的公式；决心和兴趣会转化为练习和努力。</p><p>[2] I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You’ll often get somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to a problem comes to you while taking a shower, or even in your sleep, but only because you were working hard on it the day before. It’s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation, I like to learn new things. I wouldn’t like just sitting on a beach. </p><p>[2] 我说的是按 “天” 来衡量，而非 “小时”。你常常会在 “不工作” 时有所进展 —— 比如洗澡时甚至睡梦中想到问题的解决方案，但这只是因为前一天你在这件事上付出了努力。偶尔度假是好的，但我度假时喜欢学新东西。我不喜欢只是坐在沙滩上。</p><p>[3] The thing kids do in school that’s most like the real version is sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played in schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly what adults do. In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending to do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend. Arguably the latter is no worse. </p><p>[3] 孩子们在学校做的事情中，最接近 “真实版本” 的是体育运动。诚然，很多运动起源于学校里的游戏。但至少在这一领域，孩子们做的和成年人完全一样。在普通的美国高中，你可以选择 “假装做正经事”，或者 “认真做假事”。可以说，后者并不比前者差。</p><p>[4] Knowing what you want to work on doesn’t mean you’ll be able to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things they don’t want to, especially early on. But if you know what you want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in. </p><p>[4] 知道自己想做什么工作，不代表就能去做。大多数人不得不花大量时间做自己不想做的事，尤其是在早期。但如果你知道自己想做什么，至少知道该把人生推向哪个方向。</p><p>[5] The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to the problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch to harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately. </p><p>[5] 高强度工作的时间限制较低，这为 “有孩子后工作时间减少” 的问题提供了一个解决方案：转向更难的问题。实际上我就是这么做的，尽管并非刻意。</p><p>[6] Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I don’t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something important and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing things that don’t matter. I don’t know enough to say for sure whether it’s net good or bad, but my guess is bad. </p><p>[6] 有些文化有 “表演式努力” 的传统。我不喜欢这个想法，因为（a）它把重要的事情变成了滑稽模仿；（b）它让人们在无意义的事情上耗尽精力。我了解得不够多，无法确定其整体是好是坏，但我猜是坏的。</p><p>[7] One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that startups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both decisive and conspicuous. </p><p>[7] 人们在初创公司如此努力的原因之一是：初创公司可能失败，而失败往往是决定性且显眼的。</p><p>[8] It’s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need to solve the money problem somehow, and there’s nothing wrong with doing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose it would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake; whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you’re conscious of your motivations. The thing to avoid is unconsciously letting the need for money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most interesting. </p><p>[8] 为了赚大钱而工作是没问题的。你总得解决钱的问题，通过努力一次性多赚点来高效解决，这没什么不对。我甚至觉得，为了钱本身而对钱感兴趣也没问题 —— 只要是你喜欢的就好。关键是要清楚自己的动机。要避免的是：无意识地让对钱的需求扭曲你对 “自己最感兴趣的工作” 的判断。</p><p>[9] Many people face this question on a smaller scale with individual projects. But it’s easier both to recognize and to accept a dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work entirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a Spanish Flu victim, you’re fighting your own immune system: Instead of giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who can say you’re not right?</p><p>[9] 很多人在单个项目中也会遇到类似问题，只是规模更小。但承认某个项目走进死胡同，比彻底放弃某类工作要容易得多。你越有决心，就越难放弃。就像西班牙流感患者一样，你在和自己的免疫系统对抗：你告诉自己 “应该更努力”，而不是放弃。可谁又能说你不对呢？</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="HOW-TO-START-GOOGLE"><a href="#HOW-TO-START-GOOGLE" class="headerlink" title="HOW TO START GOOGLE"></a>HOW TO START GOOGLE</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/google.html">https://paulgraham.com/google.html</a></p><p>March 2024 </p><h3 id="一、创业——为自己的项目奋斗"><a href="#一、创业——为自己的项目奋斗" class="headerlink" title="一、创业——为自己的项目奋斗"></a>一、创业——为自己的项目奋斗</h3><p>(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think they should tell students something about startups. This is what I think they should tell them.) </p><p>（这是我给 14 至 15 岁青少年的演讲，内容关于如果未来想创业，现在应该做什么。许多学校认为需要向学生传授创业知识，以下是我认为他们该传达的内容。）</p><p>Most of you probably think that when you’re released into the so-called real world you’ll eventually have to get some kind of job. That’s not true, and today I’m going to talk about a trick you can use to avoid ever having to get a job. The trick is to start your own company. </p><p>你们中的大多数人可能认为，当你们进入所谓的 “现实世界” 后，最终都得找份工作。但事实并非如此。今天我要分享一个让你们永远不用打工的秘诀 —— 创办自己的公司。</p><p>So it’s not a trick for avoiding work, because if you start your own company you’ll work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including a boss telling you what to do. </p><p>这并非逃避劳动的捷径，因为创业会比普通工作更辛苦，但你能避开职场中诸多烦心事，比如被老板颐指气使。</p><p>It’s more exciting to work on your own project than someone else’s. And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard way to get really rich. If you look at the lists of the richest people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of them did it by starting their own companies. </p><p>为自己的项目奋斗比为他人打工更令人兴奋，也能让你更富有。事实上，这是通往财富的常规路径。看看媒体偶尔公布的富豪榜，几乎所有人都是通过创业积累财富的。</p><p>Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber shop to starting Google. I’m here to talk about one extreme end of that continuum. I’m going to tell you how to start Google. </p><p>创业可以是开理发店，也可以是创办谷歌。我今天要探讨的是这个光谱的极端 —— 如何创办谷歌。</p><p>The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups when they’re young. The reason I know about them is that my wife Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup, because we’ve helped people do it for the last 19 years. </p><p>处于谷歌级别的初创公司在早期被称为 “startups”（初创企业）。我对这类公司的了解源于我和妻子杰西卡创立的 Y Combinator—— 一个 “初创企业工厂”。自 2005 年以来，我们已投资超过 4000 家初创公司，因此深知创业所需的要素，毕竟我们用了 19 年时间帮助人们实现这一目标。</p><p>You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell you how to start Google. You might be thinking “How could we start Google?” But that’s effectively what the people who did start Google were thinking before they started it. If you’d told Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars, their heads would have exploded. </p><p>你可能觉得我在开玩笑，毕竟 “如何创办谷歌” 听起来遥不可及。但当年拉里・佩奇和谢尔盖・布林在创立谷歌前，也正是这么想的。如果当时告诉他们，这家即将成立的公司未来市值会超过万亿美元，他们肯定会惊掉下巴。</p><h3 id="二、怎样开始创业"><a href="#二、怎样开始创业" class="headerlink" title="二、怎样开始创业"></a>二、怎样开始创业</h3><p>All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it seems worth pursuing. You can’t know whether it will turn into a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I say I’m going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I’m going to tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google. [1] </p><p>创业初期，你唯一能确定的是项目值得尝试，却无法预知它会成为价值千亿的巨头还是黯然倒闭。因此，当我说 “如何创办谷歌” 时，实际是指如何让你的公司拥有与谷歌当年相当的成功潜力。</p><p>How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can start a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you’re going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with. </p><p>从现在到成功创业，你需要具备三点：掌握某项技术、拥有产品创意、找到联合创始人。</p><h4 id="掌握技术"><a href="#掌握技术" class="headerlink" title="掌握技术"></a>掌握技术</h4><p>How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don’t try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You’ll work much harder on something you’re interested in than something you’re doing because you think you’re supposed to. </p><p><strong>如何掌握技术？</strong> 答案很简单：动手做项目。别纠结于基因编辑、大语言模型或航天技术哪个更有前景，没人能预测未来。选择你最感兴趣的领域，因为兴趣驱动的学习效率远超被动任务。</p><p>If you’re not sure what technology to get good at, get good at programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next 10. </p><p>若不确定方向，编程是个稳妥选择。过去 30 年，编程是半数初创企业的核心技能，未来十年这一趋势看起来不会改变。</p><p>Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we’ve got this sorted. We’re already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That’s why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they’ll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing. </p><p>现在正在上计算机课的同学可能会想：“好了，这部分我们搞定了，我们已经在学编程了。” 但抱歉，这还不够。你必须做自己的项目，而不只是在课堂上学习。就算计算机课成绩很好，也可能根本没学会编程。事实上，就算从顶尖大学的计算机系毕业，也可能还是不擅长编程。这就是为什么科技公司招人时都要让你参加编程测试，不管你毕业于哪所大学、成绩多好 —— 他们知道分数和考试结果说明不了什么。</p><p>If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you’re writing a game and there’s something you want to do in it, and you don’t know how. You’re going to figure out how a lot faster than you’d learn anything in a class. </p><p>如果真想学会编程，就得做自己的项目。用这种方式学习，速度会快得多。比如你在写一个游戏，遇到某个想实现的功能却不知道怎么做，你琢磨出来的速度会比在课堂上学任何东西都快。</p><p>You don’t have to learn programming, though. If you’re wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words “make” or “build.” So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you’re most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you’re producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That’s the cutoff. </p><p>不过你也不一定非要学编程。要是好奇 “技术” 包括哪些，其实几乎所有能用 “制作” 或 “建造” 来描述的事都算：焊接、做衣服、拍视频等等，只要是你最感兴趣的就行。关键区别在于：你是在 “创造”，还是只是 “消费”？是在写电脑游戏，还是只是玩游戏？这是分水岭。</p><p>Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design. </p><p>苹果公司创始人史蒂夫・乔布斯十几岁时学过书法 —— 就是那种中世纪手稿里的漂亮字体。当时没人（包括他自己）觉得这对他的职业生涯有帮助，他只是因为感兴趣才学的。但后来这事儿帮了他大忙。让苹果真正壮大的电脑 Macintosh 问世时，恰逢计算机性能足以呈现印刷书籍般的字体，而不是 8 位游戏里那种 “计算机感” 的字体。苹果在这方面碾压了所有对手，原因之一就是：乔布斯是当时计算机行业里少数真正懂平面设计的人。</p><p>Don’t feel like your projects have to be serious. They can be as frivolous as you like, so long as you’re building things you’re excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build the kind of things they and their friends want. And that’s exactly what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one day. </p><p>别觉得你的项目必须 “正经”。只要是你热衷于打造的东西，哪怕再琐碎也没关系。大概 90% 的程序员都是从做游戏起步的。他们和朋友喜欢玩游戏，所以就做自己和朋友想要的东西。如果你 15 岁，未来想创业，就该这么做。</p><p>You don’t have to do just one project. In fact it’s good to learn about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn’t just learn calligraphy. He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable. Whatever you’re interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?) </p><p>你也不用只做一个项目。其实多学几样东西是好事。史蒂夫・乔布斯不光学了书法，还学了电子学，后者甚至更有价值。总之，选你感兴趣的就行。（发现规律了吗？）</p><p>So that’s the first of the three things you need, to get good at some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the time you start the company you’ll have spent at least 7 years practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything after practicing it for 7 years. </p><p>以上就是三样东西中的第一样：精通一种或几种技术。做到这一点的方法，和学好小提琴或足球一样：练习。如果你 22 岁创业，现在就开始写程序，那么到创业时，你至少已经练了 7 年编程 —— 任何事练 7 年，都能做得相当不错。</p><h4 id="找到创业创意"><a href="#找到创业创意" class="headerlink" title="找到创业创意"></a>找到创业创意</h4><p>Let’s suppose you’re 22 and you’ve succeeded: You’re now really good at some technology. How do you get startup ideas? It might seem like that’s the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer, how do you get the idea to start Google?</p><p>假设你 22 岁时成功了：已经精通某种技术。那创业创意从哪来？这似乎是最难的部分。就算你是个优秀的程序员，怎么会想到要创办谷歌呢？</p><p>Actually it’s easy to get startup ideas once you’re good at technology. Once you’re good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup. </p><p>其实，一旦精通了某种技术，找创业创意就不难了。当你擅长某样技术，看世界时就会发现很多 “缺失的轮廓”：技术本身的不足、以及能用这项技术解决的各种问题，每一个都是潜在的创业机会。</p><p>In the town near our house there’s a shop with a sign warning that the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at this situation would think “why don’t you just plane off the part that sticks?” </p><p>我家附近的镇上有个商店，门上挂着块牌子，提醒顾客 “门不好关”。这块牌子挂了好几年了。对店里的人来说，门老卡住可能像个神秘的自然现象，他们能做的只是挂个牌子提醒顾客。但任何一个木匠看到这种情况都会想：“为什么不把卡住的地方刨掉呢？”</p><p>Once you’re good at programming, all the missing software in the world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter. I’ll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century, American universities used to publish printed directories with all the students’ names and contact info. When I tell you what these directories were called, you’ll know which startup I’m talking about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture of each student next to their name. </p><p>一旦你擅长编程，世界上所有缺失的软件就会像木匠眼里卡住的门一样明显。举个真实的例子：20 世纪时，美国大学会出版纸质名录，上面有所有学生的名字和联系方式。我一说这些名录叫什么，你就知道我在说哪个初创企业了 —— 它们叫 “facebooks”（脸书），因为通常每个学生的名字旁边都有照片。</p><p>So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university still hasn’t gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn’t one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don’t consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks “Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.” So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users. </p><p>2002 年，马克・扎克伯格来到哈佛大学，当时学校还没把 “facebooks” 搬到网上。各个学院有自己的在线名录，但全校范围的没有。学校管理层一直在开会讨论这事儿，可能再过十年才能解决。大多数学生没意识到这是个问题。但马克是个程序员，他看到这种情况就想：“这也太蠢了。我一晚上就能写个程序解决 —— 让大家上传自己的照片，然后把数据整合到一个全校性的新网站上。” 于是他就做了，几乎一夜之间就有了数千用户。</p><p>Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a… project. There’s that word again. Projects aren’t just the best way to learn about technology. They’re also the best source of startup ideas. </p><p>当然，当时的 Facebook 还不是初创企业，只是个…… 项目。又是 “项目” 这个词。项目不仅是学习技术的最佳方式，也是创业创意的最佳来源。</p><p>Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn’t meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said “Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.” That’s how Apple started. They weren’t even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine how lame this company seemed? </p><p>在这一点上，Facebook 并不特殊。苹果和谷歌最初也都是项目。苹果一开始根本没想做成公司，史蒂夫・沃兹尼亚克只是想自己造一台电脑。后来史蒂夫・乔布斯说：“说不定我们可以把电脑设计图卖给别人。” 苹果就这样诞生了 —— 他们当时甚至不卖电脑，只卖设计图。你能想象这家公司当时看起来多不起眼吗？</p><p>Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren’t trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn’t try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for “rugby” they just gave you every web page that contained the word “rugby.” And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word “rugby,” but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, “Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.” Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought “Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let’s figure out which those are and show them first.” </p><p>谷歌也是如此。拉里和谢尔盖一开始没打算创业，只是想改进搜索功能。在谷歌出现之前，大多数搜索引擎不会按重要性排序结果。如果你搜 “橄榄球”，它们只会列出所有包含 “橄榄球” 这个词的网页。1997 年时，互联网还很小，这种方式勉强能用 —— 可能只有 20、30 个网页包含这个词。但互联网在呈指数级增长，这意味着这种搜索方式的缺陷也在呈指数级扩大。大多数用户只会想：“哇，要翻这么多结果才能找到想要的。” 就像门卡住了一样。但和马克一样，拉里和谢尔盖是程序员，他们看到这种情况就想：“这也太蠢了。有些关于橄榄球的网页肯定比其他的重要，我们得找出哪些更重要，把它们排在前面。”</p><p>It’s obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn’t obvious at the time. It’s never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That’s why the best startups grow out of projects that aren’t meant to be startups. You’re not trying to start a company. You’re just following your instincts about what’s interesting. And if you’re young and good at technology, then your unconscious instincts about what’s interesting are better than your conscious ideas about what would be a good company. </p><p>现在回头看，这显然是个伟大的创业创意，但当时并非如此。如果创办苹果、谷歌或 Facebook 的创意在当时就显而易见，早就有人做了。这就是为什么最好的初创企业都源于 “没打算做成初创企业” 的项目。你不是在刻意 “创业”，只是凭着直觉去做有趣的事。如果你年轻又擅长技术，那么你对 “什么有趣” 的潜意识直觉，会比你对 “什么能成好公司” 的有意识想法更靠谱。</p><p>So it’s critical, if you’re a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use — something your friends aren’t just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down — then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there’s a way. </p><p>所以对年轻创业者来说，关键是：做自己和朋友会用的东西。年轻创业者最大的错误，就是为某个神秘的 “其他人” 做东西。但如果你能做出自己和朋友真心想用的东西 —— 朋友用它不是因为对你的忠诚度，而是如果关掉它会真的很失落 —— 那你几乎肯定抓住了一个好创业创意的萌芽。它可能在你看来不像个 “初创企业”，可能也不清楚怎么靠它赚钱。但相信我，总有办法的。</p><p>What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren’t hard to see once you’re good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere. [2] </p><p>一个创业创意需要的，也仅仅需要的，是你的朋友真的想要它。一旦你擅长技术，这种创意其实随处可见。到处都是 “卡住的门”。[2]</p><h4 id="找到联合创始人"><a href="#找到联合创始人" class="headerlink" title="找到联合创始人"></a>找到联合创始人</h4><p>Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I’m going to say next? It’s the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who’s good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things. </p><p>现在说第三样，也是最后一样你需要的东西：联合创始人（一个或多个）。最理想的初创企业有 2 到 3 个创始人，所以你需要 1 到 2 个联合创始人。怎么找到他们？能猜到我要说什么吗？还是那句话：项目。通过一起做项目找到联合创始人。你需要的联合创始人，得是擅长自己领域、且能和你默契合作的人，而判断这一点的唯一方法，就是和他们一起做事。</p><p>At this point I’m going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that’s where the best cofounders are. It’s also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them. </p><p>这里我要说件你们可能不爱听的事：功课一定要学好，哪怕是那些只需要死记硬背或空谈文学的课。因为你需要好成绩才能进好大学。如果你想创业，就得努力进最好的大学，因为最好的联合创始人在那里，最好的员工也在那里。拉里和谢尔盖创办谷歌时，一开始就从斯坦福招了所有他们认识的最聪明的人，这对他们来说是个巨大优势。</p><p>The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the largest numbers of successful startups come from, it’s pretty much the same as the list of the most selective universities. </p><p>实证很清楚：成功初创企业数量最多的地方，和最顶尖大学的名单几乎重合。</p><p>I don’t think it’s the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it’s because the quality of the teaching is better. What’s driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you’ll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people. [3] </p><p>我不认为这是因为这些大学的名气大，也不是因为教学质量更好。真正的原因很简单：进这些大学很难。能进麻省理工或剑桥的人，往往很聪明、很有毅力。所以一旦你进去了，就会发现周围有很多聪明又有毅力的人。[3]</p><p>You don’t have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they’re where the cofounders are, they’re also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders. </p><p>你不一定非要和大学里认识的人一起创业。Twitch 的创始人 7 岁就认识了，Stripe 的创始人帕特里克・科里森和约翰・科里森，在约翰出生时就 “认识” 了。但大学是联合创始人的主要来源。正因为那里有联合创始人，所以那里也有创意 —— 最好的创意都源于你和未来的联合创始人一起做的项目。</p><p>So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university, because that’s where the cofounders and the ideas are. </p><p>所以，从现在到能创业，你要做的事其实很简单：<br>一是精通技术，方法是做自己的项目；<br>二是功课尽量做好，以便能进好大学 —— 因为那里有联合创始人和创意。</p><p>That’s it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.     </p><p>总的来说就这两件事：动手做一些东西，学好功课。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] The rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the “Google”s refer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as much chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and Sergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the time they started it. But I think the original version is zippier. </p><p>[1] 这句话的修辞技巧在于：两个 “谷歌” 指的是不同的东西。我的意思是：你创办的公司，要有 “像谷歌最终成长为巨头那样” 的可能性，就像当年拉里和谢尔盖创办谷歌时，谷歌本身具有的可能性一样。但我觉得原文的表达更简洁有力。</p><p>[2] Making something for your friends isn’t the only source of startup ideas. It’s just the best source for young founders, who have the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own wants are most predictive of future demand. </p><p>[2] 为朋友做东西不是创业创意的唯一来源，只是对年轻创业者来说最好的来源 —— 因为他们最不了解 “其他人想要什么”，而他们自己的需求最能预示未来的市场需求。</p><p>[3] Strangely enough this is particularly true in countries like the US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions departments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops that have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the more arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination and resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities in startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at selecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting students.</p><p>[3] 奇怪的是，在本科录取机制不太合理的国家（比如美国），这一点尤其明显。美国的录取部门让申请者通过很多莫名其妙的关卡，这些关卡和智力几乎无关。但关卡越莫名其妙，就越能考验纯粹的毅力和应变能力 —— 而这正是初创企业创始人最重要的两种素质。所以美国的录取部门在 “筛选创始人” 方面，比在 “筛选学生” 方面做得更好。</p>]]></content>

    <title>怎样正确的区分执着与固执</title>

New ideas often don’t work at first, but they’re not deterred. They keep trying and eventually find something that does. </p><p>成功人士往往具备执着的品质。新想法起初往往行不通，但他们不会因此却步，而是不断尝试，最终找到有效的方法。</p><p>Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate people are so annoying. They won’t listen. They beat their heads against a wall and get nowhere. </p><p>另一方面，单纯的固执则注定失败。固执的人很讨厌，他们不听劝，一味地撞南墙，却毫无进展。</p><p>But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be right or not? </p><p>但这两种情况真的有区别吗？执着的人和固执的人行为上是否真的不同？还是说他们做着同样的事，只是我们事后根据他们最终是否正确，才分别贴上 “执着” 或 “固执” 的标签？</p><p>If that’s the only difference then there’s nothing to be learned from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong, and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile to tease them apart. [1] </p><p>如果这是唯一的区别，那么这种区分就毫无借鉴意义。告诉别人要执着而非固执，无异于告诉他们要正确而非错误，而这一点他们早就知道了。然而，若执着与固执确实是两种不同的行为，那我们就有必要将它们区分开来。[1]</p><p>I’ve talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that they’re different kinds of behavior. I’ve often walked away from a conversation thinking either “Wow, that guy is determined” or “Damn, that guy is stubborn,” and I don’t think I’m just talking about whether they seemed right or not. That’s part of it, but not all of it. </p><p>我和很多意志坚定的人聊过，在我看来，这两种行为确实不同。我常常在与人交谈后，要么想 “哇，这个人真执着”，要么想 “该死，这个人真固执”，而且我认为这不仅仅是因为他们看起来正确与否。这是一部分原因，但并非全部。</p><p>There’s something annoying about the obstinate that’s not simply due to being mistaken. They won’t listen. And that’s not true of all determined people. I can’t think of anyone more determined than the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them, they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity. Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if there is, they want to know about it. </p><p>固执的人身上有种令人讨厌的特质，这不仅仅是因为他们犯错了。他们不听劝。但并非所有意志坚定的人都是如此。我想不出比科利森兄弟更执着的人了，当你向他们指出问题时，他们不仅会听，而且会带着近乎掠夺性的专注去听。他们的船底有洞吗？可能没有，但如果真有，他们一定想知道。</p><p>It’s the same with most successful people. They’re never more engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate don’t want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about matters of doctrine. [2] </p><p>大多数成功人士都是如此。当你与他们意见相左时，他们会格外投入。而固执的人却不想听你说。当你指出问题时，他们眼神涣散，回答听起来就像理论家在谈论教条。[2]</p><p>The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that they’re both hard to stop. But they’re hard to stop in different senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can’t be throttled back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can’t be turned. [3] </p><p>执着者和固执者看似相似，是因为他们都难以被阻止。但他们的 “难以被阻止” 意义不同。执着者就像引擎无法减速的船，而固执者就像舵无法转动的船。[3]</p><p>In the degenerate case they’re indistinguishable: when there’s only one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down, while the obstinate spray “don’t give up” indiscriminately over the whole tree. </p><p>在退化的情况下，两者难以区分：当解决问题只有一种方法时，你唯一的选择就是放弃或不放弃，而执着和固执都意味着不放弃。这大概就是为什么这两种特质在流行文化中常常被混为一谈。流行文化假设的是简单的问题。但随着问题变得越来越复杂，我们就能看出两者的区别了。执着的人更执着于决策树高层的要点，而对低层的次要要点则不那么在意，而固执的人则会不加区分地 “不放弃” 整个决策树。</p><h3 id="二、固执可能的起因与本质"><a href="#二、固执可能的起因与本质" class="headerlink" title="二、固执可能的起因与本质"></a>二、固执可能的起因与本质</h3><p>The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached to their ideas about how to reach it. </p><p>执着的人执着于目标，而固执的人执着于自己达成目标的想法。</p><p>Worse still, that means they’ll tend to be attached to their first ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren’t merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be attached to wrong ones.  </p><p>更糟糕的是，这意味着他们往往会执着于自己解决问题的最初想法，尽管这些想法是最缺乏实践经验支撑的。因此，固执的人不仅执着于细节，而且极有可能执着于错误的细节。</p><p>Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One possibility is that they’re overwhelmed. They’re not very capable. They take on a hard problem. They’re immediately in over their head. So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling ship might grab onto the nearest handhold. </p><p>为什么他们会这样？固执的人为什么会固执？一种可能是他们不堪重负。他们能力不足，却承担了一个艰难的任务，很快就力不从心了。于是他们抓住一些想法不放，就像在摇晃的船上，有人会抓住最近的扶手一样。</p><p>That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn’t hold up. If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one’s head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making them solve harder problems. But that’s not what happens. If you handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they wouldn’t become obstinate. If anything they’d become less obstinate. They’d know they had to be open to anything. </p><p>这是我最初的想法，但仔细想想，这并不成立。如果固执仅仅是因为力不从心，那么通过让执着的人去解决更难的问题，就能让他们变得固执。但事实并非如此。如果你让科利森兄弟去解决一个极难的问题，他们不会变得固执。如果说有什么不同的话，他们会变得不那么固执。他们知道自己必须对一切持开放态度。</p><p>Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they don’t. And if obstinacy isn’t caused by the situation, it must come from within. It must be a feature of one’s personality. </p><p>同样，如果固执是由环境造成的，那么当固执的人去解决更容易的问题时，他们就不会再固执了。但他们并没有。如果固执不是由环境造成的，那它一定源于内在，一定是个人性格的一种特征。</p><p>Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one’s ideas. This is not identical with stupidity, but they’re closely related. A reflexive resistance to changing one’s ideas becomes a sort of induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a form of not giving up that’s easily practiced by the stupid. You don’t have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your heels. It even works, up to a point. </p><p>固执是一种对改变想法的本能抗拒。这与愚蠢并不完全相同，但两者密切相关。随着反对证据的增多，这种对改变想法的本能抗拒会演变成一种诱发的愚蠢。固执是一种不放弃的表现，愚蠢的人很容易做到这一点。你不必考虑复杂的权衡，只需固执己见。在某种程度上，这甚至是有效的。</p><p>The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren’t opposites. The relationship between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When you leap suddenly away from a threat, that’s what you’re using. </p><p>固执在简单问题上能奏效，这是一个重要的线索。执着和固执并非对立面。它们之间的关系更像是我们能进行的两种呼吸方式：有氧呼吸和我们从远古祖先那里继承的无氧呼吸。无氧呼吸是一种更原始的过程，但它有其用途。当你突然跳起来躲避威胁时，你用的就是无氧呼吸。</p><p>The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking “I won’t give up,” because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum, the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems. [4]  </p><p>固执的最佳量并非零。如果面对挫折，你的第一反应是不假思索地 “我不会放弃”，这可能是好事，因为这有助于防止恐慌。但不假思索的作用有限。一个人越是倾向于固执，就越不可能成功解决难题。[4]</p><p>Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns out to have a fairly complicated internal structure. </p><p>固执是一种简单的东西，动物也有。但事实证明，执着有着相当复杂的内在结构。</p><h3 id="三、执着可能的起因与本质"><a href="#三、执着可能的起因与本质" class="headerlink" title="三、执着可能的起因与本质"></a>三、执着可能的起因与本质</h3><p>One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep thinking of things to try. Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the best out of the other. </p><p>执着者的一个特点是他们的精力。也许过分强调词语的含义不太好，但他们是 “坚持下去”，而不仅仅是 “抵抗”。他们不断尝试。这意味着执着的人还必须富有想象力。要不断尝试，你就必须不断想出新的点子。</p><p>Energy creates demand for the ideas produced by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives energy somewhere to go. [5] </p><p>精力和想象力是一对绝妙的组合，彼此能让对方发挥出最佳水平。精力为想象力产生的想法创造需求，从而促使想象力产生更多想法，而想象力则为精力提供了方向。[5]</p><p>Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal. </p><p>仅仅拥有精力和想象力是相当罕见的。但要解决难题，你还需要另外三种品质：韧性、良好的判断力和对某种目标的专注。</p><p>Resilience means not having one’s morale destroyed by setbacks. Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if you can’t bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience means setbacks can’t change your morale, not that they can’t change your mind. </p><p>韧性意味着不会因挫折而士气低落。一旦问题达到一定规模，挫折就不可避免，所以如果你不能从挫折中恢复过来，你就只能在小规模的事情上做出成绩。但韧性与固执不同。韧性意味着挫折不能改变你的士气，而不是说挫折不能改变你的想法。</p><p>Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one’s mind. That’s where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite rational. They focus on expected value. It’s this, not recklessness, that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed. </p><p>事实上，执着往往需要人改变想法。这就需要良好的判断力了。执着的人非常理性，他们关注预期价值。正是这一点，而非鲁莽，让他们能够从事那些成功可能性不大的事情。</p><p>There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they’ll often classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies. </p><p>不过，在决策树的顶端，执着的人往往会不理性：当他们在两个预期价值大致相等的问题之间做出选择时，选择通常取决于个人偏好。事实上，他们往往会将项目故意划分为广泛的预期价值区间，以确保他们想做的项目仍然符合条件。</p><p>Empirically this doesn’t seem to be a problem. It’s ok to be irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there’s another more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems aren’t random. When we love a problem that other people don’t, it’s often because we’ve unconsciously noticed that it’s more important than they realize. </p><p>从经验来看，这似乎不是问题。在决策树的顶端不理性是可以接受的。一个原因是，我们人类会更努力地去解决自己喜欢的问题。但还有一个更微妙的因素：我们对那些别人不喜欢的问题的偏好，往往是因为我们下意识地注意到这些问题比别人意识到的更重要。</p><p>Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall goal. If you’re like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly be done. But in practice it’s not much use, precisely because it includes too much. It doesn’t tell you what to do at this moment. </p><p>这就引出了第五种品质：需要有一个总体目标。如果你像我一样，小时候只是渴望做一些伟大的事情。理论上，这应该是最强大的动力，因为它包含了所有可能要做的事情。但实际上，它没什么用，正是因为它包含的太多了，它无法告诉你此刻该做什么。</p><p>So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what you’re searching for, but not too general, or it won’t work to motivate you. [6] </p><p>所以，在实践中，你的精力、想象力、韧性和良好的判断力必须指向某个相当具体的目标。不能太具体，否则你可能会错过与你正在寻找的东西相关的重大发现，但也不能太笼统，否则就无法激励你。[6]</p><p>When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn’t resemble obstinacy at all. It’s so much more complex. Five distinct qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But the way you don’t give up is completely different. Instead of merely resisting change, you’re driven toward a goal by energy and resilience, through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement. You’ll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up. </p><p>当你审视执着的内在结构时，会发现它与固执一点也不像，它要复杂得多。五种不同的品质 —— 精力、想象力、韧性、良好的判断力和对目标的专注 —— 结合在一起，产生了一种看似有点像固执的现象，因为它让你不放弃。但你不放弃的方式完全不同。你不是仅仅抗拒改变，而是在精力和韧性的驱动下朝着目标前进，通过想象力发现路径，并通过判断力优化路径。如果决策树下层的某个要点的预期价值大幅下降，你会放弃它，但精力和韧性会推动你朝着你在决策树上层选择的目标前进。</p><p>Considering what it’s made of, it’s not surprising that the right kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed, kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people have enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.    </p><p>考虑到执着的构成，难怪正确的固执比错误的固执罕见得多，也难怪它能取得好得多的结果。任何人都可以固执，事实上，孩子、醉汉和傻瓜最擅长这个。而拥有产生正确固执的所有五种品质的人非常少，但当他们拥有这些品质时，结果是不可思议的。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] I’m going to use “persistent” for the good kind of stubborn and “obstinate” for the bad kind, but I can’t claim I’m simply following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind, but it seemed better just to stretch “persistent.” </p><p>[1] 我将用 “执着（persistent）” 指代那种有益的固执，用 “固执（obstinate）” 指代有害的固执，但我并非完全遵循现有用法。传统观念几乎不区分固执的好坏，因此这两个词的使用也相应地混乱。我本可以为有益的固执创造一个新词，但似乎还是延伸 “执着” 的含义更好。</p><p>[2] There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate. Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won’t work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous for getting power, not for using it well. </p><p>[2] 在某些领域，固执也能成功。有些政治领袖就因固执而出名。但在需要通过外部检验的情况下，固执行不通。事实上，那些因固执而闻名的政治领袖，出名的是他们获取权力的方式，而非运用权力的能力。</p><p>[3] There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a persistent person, because there’s some cost to changing direction. </p><p>[3] 要改变执着者的方向（转动他们的 “舵”），多少会遇到一些阻力，因为改变方向总要付出代价。</p><p>[4] The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems. One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that’s right twice a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates, their estimates of the probability of success will always be off in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says “push ahead regardless” in every borderline case, he’ll usually turn out to be right. </p><p>[4] 固执的人有时也能解决难题。一种情况是靠运气：就像停摆的时钟每天也能准两次，他们抓住某个随意的想法，结果碰巧是对的。另一种情况是，他们的固执抵消了其他形式的错误。例如，若领导者的下属过于谨慎，他们对成功概率的估计总会偏向同一个错误方向。这时，若领导者在所有边缘案例中都盲目说 “无论如何都要推进”，往往最终会被证明是对的。</p><p>[5] If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get the conventional caricature of an artist or poet. </p><p>[5] 若仅停留在精力和想象力这两点，就会陷入人们对艺术家或诗人的固有刻板印象中。</p><p>[6] Start by erring on the small side. If you’re inexperienced you’ll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on the side of making the goal too broad, you won’t get anywhere. Whereas if you err on the small side you’ll at least be moving forward. Then, once you’re moving, you expand the goal.</p><p>[6] 开始时，目标宁小勿大。缺乏经验时，你难免会在目标设定上有所偏差：若目标定得太宽泛，你会一事无成；若目标定得小一点，至少能向前推进。一旦开始行动，再逐步扩大目标范围。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="THE-NEED-TO-READ"><a href="#THE-NEED-TO-READ" class="headerlink" title="THE NEED TO READ"></a>THE NEED TO READ</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/read.html">https://paulgraham.com/read.html</a></p><p>November 2022</p><p>In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge. Mysterious “tapes” would load it into one’s brain like a program being loaded into a computer. </p><p>在我小时候读的科幻小说里，阅读往往已被某种更高效的知识获取方式取代。神秘的 “磁带” 能将知识载入大脑，就像给电脑加载程序一样。</p><p>That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about x doesn’t just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write. [1] </p><p>这类事情短期内不太可能发生。不仅因为构建阅读的替代品难度极大，更因为即便存在这样的替代品，它也无法满足需求。阅读关于某事物的内容，不仅能让你了解该事物，还能教会你如何写作。[1]</p><p>Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be good at writing? </p><p>这很重要吗？如果我们找到了取代阅读的方法，还需要有人擅长写作吗？</p><p>The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them. </p><p>重要的原因在于，写作不仅是传达思想的方式，更是产生思想的方式。</p><p>A good writer doesn’t just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But even after doing this, you’ll find you still discover new things when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. </p><p>优秀的作家并非先思考，再把想法像抄本一样写下来。优秀的作家几乎总会在写作过程中发现新东西。而且据我所知，这种发现是无可替代的。与他人探讨想法是完善思想的好方法，但即便如此，当你坐下来写作时，仍会发现新的东西。有一种思考，只能通过写作完成。</p><p>There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without writing. If you don’t need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you’re thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won’t help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which in turn means that someone who’s not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems. </p><p>当然，有些思考无需写作也能进行。如果不需要深入钻研某个问题，你可以不写就能解决它。比如思考两台机器如何组装时，写作可能没多大帮助。当一个问题可以被形式化描述时，有时也能在脑中解决。但如果要解决一个复杂且定义模糊的问题，写作几乎总能起到帮助。这意味着，不擅长写作的人在解决这类问题时，几乎总会处于劣势。</p><p>You can’t think well without writing well, and you can’t write well without reading well. And I mean that last “well” in both senses. You have to be good at reading, and read good things. [2] </p><p>写不好，就无法思考透彻；读不好，就写不好。这里的 “好” 有两层含义：你既要擅长阅读，也要读优秀的作品。[2]</p><p>People who just want information may find other ways to get it. But people who want to have ideas can’t afford to.      </p><p>只想获取信息的人或许能找到其他途径。但想要产生思想的人，却不能放弃阅读。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having them read to you doesn’t teach you as much about writing as reading them yourself. </p><p>[1] 有声书能为你提供优秀写作的范例，但听别人读，不如自己读更能教会你写作。</p><p>[2] By “good at reading” I don’t mean good at the mechanics of reading. You don’t have to be good at extracting words from the page so much as extracting meaning from the words.</p><p>[2] 我说的 “擅长阅读”，并非指阅读的技巧。你不必擅长从书页中识别文字，而应擅长从文字中提炼意义。</p>]]></content>

    <title>散文领域的格局</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="THE-SHAPE-OF-THE-ESSAY-FIELD"><a href="#THE-SHAPE-OF-THE-ESSAY-FIELD" class="headerlink" title="THE SHAPE OF THE ESSAY FIELD"></a>THE SHAPE OF THE ESSAY FIELD</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/field.html">https://paulgraham.com/field.html</a></p><p>June 2025</p><p>An essay has to tell people something they don’t already know. But there are three different reasons people might not know something, and they yield three very different kinds of essays. </p><p>一篇散文必须告诉人们一些他们不知道的东西。但人们之所以不知道某件事，原因有三，而这三种原因催生出了三种截然不同的散文。</p><p>One reason people won’t know something is if it’s not important to know. That doesn’t mean it will make a bad essay. For example, you might write a good essay about a particular model of car. Readers would learn something from it. It would add to their picture of the world. For a handful of readers it might even spur some kind of epiphany. But unless this is a very unusual car it’s not critical for everyone to know about it. [1] </p><p>第一种原因是，这件事并不重要，不值得了解。但这并不意味着写这类内容就成不了好散文。比如，你可以写一篇关于某款特定车型的好散文。读者能从中学到东西，这会丰富他们对世界的认知。对少数读者来说，它甚至可能引发某种顿悟。但除非这是一款极不寻常的车，否则并非所有人都非了解它不可。[1]</p><p>If something isn’t important to know, there’s no answer to the question of why people don’t know it. Not knowing random facts is the default. But if you’re going to write about things that are important to know, you have to ask why your readers don’t already know them. Is it because they’re smart but inexperienced, or because they’re obtuse? </p><p>如果某件事不重要，那 “人们为什么不知道它” 这个问题就没有答案。不了解随机的琐事，本就是常态。但如果你要写的是值得了解的重要事物，就必须问自己：读者为什么偏偏不知道它？是因为他们聪明却缺乏经验，还是因为他们迟钝？</p><p>So the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell them are (a) that it’s not important, (b) that they’re obtuse, or (c) that they’re inexperienced. </p><p>所以，读者不知道你所要讲述的内容，原因有三：（a）内容不重要；（b）读者迟钝；（c）读者缺乏经验。</p><p>The reason I did this breakdown was to get at the following fact, which might have seemed controversial if I’d led with it, but should be obvious now. If you’re writing for smart people about important things, you’re writing for the young. </p><p>我做这种区分，是为了得出一个结论 —— 如果一开始就说，可能显得有争议，但现在看来应该很明显了：如果你要为聪明的人写重要的事，其实是在为年轻人写。</p><p>Or more precisely, that’s where you’ll have the most effect. Whatever you say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old you are. It’s not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something you write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will presumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to you. </p><p>更准确地说，这是你能产生最大影响的群体。无论你年龄多大，你所写的内容至少对自己来说也该有点新意。否则就不能称之为散文，因为散文本就是你为了弄明白某事而写的东西。但你弄明白的道理，对年轻读者来说，想必会比对你自己更令人惊讶。</p><p>There’s a continuum of surprise. At one extreme, something you read can change your whole way of thinking. The Selfish Gene did this to me. It was like suddenly seeing the other interpretation of an ambiguous image: you can treat genes rather than organisms as the protagonists, and evolution becomes easier to understand when you do. At the other extreme, writing merely puts into words something readers were already thinking — or thought they were. </p><p>惊喜是一个连续体。一端是，你读到的内容能彻底改变你的思维方式。《自私的基因》对我就是如此。这就像突然看懂了一幅模糊图像的另一种解读：你可以把基因而非生物体当作主角，这样一来，进化论就更容易理解了。另一端是，文字只是把读者已经在想（或者自以为在想）的东西表达出来而已。</p><p>The impact of an essay is how much it changes readers’ thinking multiplied by the importance of the topic. But it’s hard to do well at both. It’s hard to have big new ideas about important topics. So in practice there’s a tradeoff: you can change readers’ thinking a lot about moderately important things, or change it a little about very important ones. But with younger readers the tradeoff shifts. There’s more room to change their thinking, so there’s a bigger payoff for writing about important things. </p><p>一篇散文的影响力，等于它改变读者思维的程度乘以主题的重要性。但两者很难兼顾。对重要的主题产生重大的新见解，并非易事。所以实际上存在一种权衡：你可以在中等重要的事情上极大地改变读者的想法，或者在非常重要的事情上略微改变他们的想法。但对年轻读者而言，这种权衡会发生偏移。改变他们的思维有更大的空间，所以写重要的内容能带来更大的回报。</p><p>The tradeoff isn’t a conscious one, at least not for me. It’s more like a kind of gravitational field that writers work in. But every essayist works in it, whether they realize it or not. </p><p>这种权衡并非刻意为之，至少对我来说不是。它更像是作家身处的一种引力场。但每个散文作家，无论是否意识到，都身处其中。</p><p>This seems obvious once you state it, but it took me a long time to understand. I knew I wanted to write for smart people about important topics. I noticed empirically that I seemed to be writing for the young. But it took me years to understand that the latter was an automatic consequence of the former. In fact I only really figured it out as I was writing this essay. </p><p>说出来之后似乎显而易见，但我花了很久才明白这一点。我知道自己想为聪明的人写重要的事，也从经验中发现，自己似乎是在为年轻人写。但多年后我才明白，后者是前者的必然结果。事实上，直到写这篇散文时，我才真正想通。</p><p>Now that I know it, should I change anything? I don’t think so. In fact seeing the shape of the field that writers work in has reminded me that I’m not optimizing for returns in it. I’m not trying to surprise readers of any particular age; I’m trying to surprise myself. </p><p>既然明白了这一点，我应该做出改变吗？我觉得不必。事实上，看清作家所处领域的格局后，我反而意识到，自己并非在为追求回报而写作。我不是想给某个年龄段的读者带来惊喜，而是想给自己带来惊喜。</p><p>The way I usually decide what to write about is by following curiosity. I notice something new and dig into it. It would probably be a mistake to change that. But seeing the shape of the essay field has set me thinking. What would surprise young readers? Which important things do people tend to learn late? Interesting question. I should think about that.    </p><p>我通常通过追随好奇心来决定写什么。发现新事物，就深入挖掘。改变这种方式或许是个错误。但看清散文领域的格局后，我开始思考：什么能给年轻读者带来惊喜？哪些重要的东西，人们往往很晚才明白？这是个有趣的问题，我该好好想想。</p><p>Note </p><p>[1] It’s hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant topic, though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw the topic into deeper waters. E. B. White could write an essay about how to boil potatoes that ended up being full of timeless wisdom. In which case, of course, it wouldn’t really be about how to boil potatoes; that would just have been the starting point. </p><p>[1] 不过，写一篇关于不重要话题的真正好散文并不容易，因为真正优秀的散文作家总会不可避免地将话题引向更深刻的层面。E.B. 怀特可以写一篇关于如何煮土豆的散文，最终却充满了永恒的智慧。当然，在这种情况下，文章其实并非真的在讲煮土豆，那只是一个起点而已。</p>]]></content>

    <title>如何浪费时间与金钱</title>

    <url>/2025/07/21/how-to-waste-time-and-money/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="HOW-TO-WASTE-TIME-AND-MONEY"><a href="#HOW-TO-WASTE-TIME-AND-MONEY" class="headerlink" title="HOW TO WASTE TIME AND MONEY"></a>HOW TO WASTE TIME AND MONEY</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html">https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html</a></p><p>July 2010</p><h3 id="一、如何对金钱流失保持警觉"><a href="#一、如何对金钱流失保持警觉" class="headerlink" title="一、如何对金钱流失保持警觉"></a>一、如何对金钱流失保持警觉</h3><p>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money. I now had to think about something I hadn’t had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I’d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were. </p><p>1998 年，当我们卖掉自己的初创公司时，我突然有了一大笔钱。这时，我不得不开始思考一个此前从未想过的问题：如何守住这笔钱。我知道，人可以从贫穷变富有，同样也可能从富有变贫穷。过去几年，我花了大量时间研究从穷到富的路径，但对于从富到穷的路径，我几乎一无所知。而现在，为了避开这些陷阱，我必须弄清楚它们到底在哪里。</p><p>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you’d asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I’d have said by spending all their money. That’s how it happens in books and movies, because that’s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments. </p><p>于是，我开始留意财富是如何流失的。小时候如果有人问我，富人是怎么变穷的，我会说他们是把钱都花光了。书籍和电影里都是这么演的，因为这种方式更富有戏剧性。但事实上，大多数财富的流失并非源于过度消费，而是糟糕的投资。</p><p>It’s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking “wow, I’m spending a lot of money.” Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye. </p><p>大把花钱却毫无察觉，这很难做到。一个品味普通的人，花掉几万美元后，总会想 “哇，我花了好多钱”。但如果你开始做衍生品交易，可能一眨眼的功夫就会输掉 100 万美元（说真的，想输多少就能输多少）。</p><p>In most people’s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn’t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you’ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You’re not spending the money; you’re just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say “it’s an investment.” </p><p>在大多数人看来，花钱买奢侈品会让人警觉，但投资却不会。奢侈品似乎是放纵自己的表现。而且，除非你的钱是继承来的或者中彩票得来的，否则你早就被反复告诫：放纵会招致麻烦。而投资则绕过了这些警报 —— 你不是在花钱，只是把钱从一种资产转移到另一种资产而已。这也是为什么那些推销昂贵东西的人会说 “这是一项投资”。</p><p>The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive. </p><p>解决办法是建立新的警报机制。这可能有点棘手，因为防止过度消费的警报机制非常基础，甚至可能存在于我们的基因中，而防止糟糕投资的警报机制则需要学习，有时还相当违背直觉。</p><p>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you’re being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I’d feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I’d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day. </p><h3 id="二、浪费时间最危险的方式"><a href="#二、浪费时间最危险的方式" class="headerlink" title="二、浪费时间最危险的方式"></a>二、浪费时间最危险的方式</h3><p>几天前，我意识到一件令人惊讶的事：时间的情况和金钱非常相似。浪费时间最危险的方式，不是花时间享乐，而是做 “虚假工作”。当你花时间享乐时，你知道自己在放纵，警报很快就会响起。如果我早上醒来，坐在沙发上看一整天电视，我会觉得哪里不对劲。光是想想就让我畏缩 —— 坐沙发上看两个小时电视我就会不舒服，更别说一整天了。</p><p>And yet I’ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I’d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I’d feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don’t go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I’m doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It’s not fun. So it must be work. </p><p>但我确实有过这样的日子：一整天下来，要是问自己做了什么，答案基本是 “什么也没做”。这样的日子过后我也会难受，但远不如看一整天电视那么难受。如果看了一整天电视，我会觉得自己在堕落。但在那些一事无成的日子里，警报却不会响起，因为我在做的事情表面上看起来像正经工作。比如处理邮件 —— 你坐在办公桌前做这件事，而且并不觉得有趣，所以它肯定是工作。</p><p>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they’re not even fun.</p><p>对待时间和对待金钱一样，仅仅避免享乐已经不够了。对于狩猎采集者，或许对所有前工业社会的人来说，这可能就够了。所以，先天本能和后天教育共同让我们避免放纵。但世界变得更复杂了：最危险的陷阱是那些新行为 —— 它们通过模仿更有益的行为，绕过了我们对放纵的警报。最糟糕的是，这些行为甚至毫无乐趣可言。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="HAVING-KIDS"><a href="#HAVING-KIDS" class="headerlink" title="HAVING KIDS"></a>HAVING KIDS</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/kids.html">https://paulgraham.com/kids.html</a></p><p>December 2019</p><h3 id="一、有小孩之前"><a href="#一、有小孩之前" class="headerlink" title="一、有小孩之前"></a>一、有小孩之前</h3><p>Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I’d have been sad to think I’d never have children. But did I want them now? No. </p><p>在有孩子之前，我一直害怕要孩子。那时候，我对孩子的感觉，就像年轻时的奥古斯丁对 “过有德行的生活” 的感觉 —— 一想到自己永远不会有孩子，我会难过；但要说 “现在就想要”？不，我不想要。</p><p>If I had kids, I’d become a parent, and parents, as I’d known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it’s not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn’t seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I’d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed. </p><p>如果有了孩子，我就会变成父母。而从我小时候起，父母在我眼里就是 “不酷” 的代名词：他们乏味、刻板，满脑子都是责任，完全无法享受生活。当然，孩子会这么想并不奇怪，但说实话，即便长大成人，我也没看到多少能改变这想法的事。每次看到带孩子的父母，孩子似乎都是些小恶魔，父母则是可怜兮兮、被折腾得焦头烂额的人 —— 哪怕他们最后 “镇住” 了孩子，也还是一副狼狈相。</p><p>When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn’t feel it at all. “Better you than me,” I was thinking. </p><p>别人生孩子时，我会热情地祝贺，因为那似乎是 “该做的事”。但我心里毫无波澜，甚至在想：“还好是你，不是我。”</p><p>Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world. </p><p>现在，别人生孩子时，我依然会热情祝贺，而且是发自内心的 —— 尤其是第一个孩子。我觉得他们像是收到了世界上最好的礼物。</p><p>What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful. </p><p>当然，一切的转变都源于我自己有了孩子。曾经让我恐惧的事，最后竟成了美好的馈赠。</p><h3 id="二、有小孩之后"><a href="#二、有小孩之后" class="headerlink" title="二、有小孩之后"></a>二、有小孩之后</h3><p>Partly, and I won’t deny it, this is because of serious chemical changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking “I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone’s child!” </p><p>不得不承认，很大程度上是因为第一个孩子出生时，我体内瞬间发生了剧烈的化学变化。就像有人扳动了开关：我突然不仅想保护自己的孩子，还想保护所有孩子。记得开车载着妻子和刚出生的儿子从医院回家时，路过一个挤满行人的斑马线，我心里突然冒出一个念头：“我得对这些人万分小心。他们每一个，都是别人的孩子啊！”</p><p>So to some extent you can’t trust me when I say having kids is great. To some extent I’m like a religious cultist telling you that you’ll be happy if you join the cult too — but only because joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you happy to be a cult member. </p><p>所以，当我说 “有孩子很棒” 时，你多少得打个折扣。某种程度上，我就像个邪教徒 —— 告诉你 “加入我们你就会快乐”，但真相是，只有加入后，你的大脑才会被改造，让你觉得作为教徒很快乐。</p><p>But not entirely. There were some things about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them. </p><p>但也不全是这样。有孩子这件事，我之前确实有很多明显的误解。</p><p>For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed that I wrote “Whenever I’d noticed parents with kids.” Of course the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed them? Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes. Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler is something very few parents enjoy. </p><p>比如，我对父母和孩子的观察存在严重的 “选择性偏差”。也许有父母注意到了，我写的是 “每次我‘注意到’带孩子的父母”。当然了，我会注意到孩子，往往是因为他们 “出状况” 的时候 —— 只有他们吵闹时，我才会留意到。而且，我是在什么场合注意到他们的呢？平时我根本不去有孩子的地方，唯一能碰到孩子的场合，都是像飞机这样的 “共用瓶颈” 场所。这显然不是有代表性的样本 —— 带学步的孩子坐飞机，没几个父母会觉得享受。</p><p>What I didn’t notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were all the great moments parents had with kids. People don’t talk about these much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway — but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you’d rather be, and nothing else you’d rather be doing. You don’t have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn’t trade these moments for anything. One doesn’t tend to associate kids with peace, but that’s what you feel. You don’t need to look any further than where you are right now. </p><p>那些父母和孩子相处的美好时刻，我从来没注意到，因为它们大多安安静静的。人们很少谈论这些时刻 —— 那种魔力很难用语言描述，而且其他父母都懂 —— 但有孩子的一大好处是，你会频繁地觉得 “此刻就是最好的，做什么都不如现在”。不一定是做什么特别的事：可能只是一起出门，可能是哄他们睡觉，可能是在公园推他们荡秋千。但这些时刻，你无论如何都不愿交换。没人会把 “孩子” 和 “平静” 联系起来，但你真的会感到平静 —— 你会觉得，眼前的一切就足够了。</p><p>Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day. </p><p>有孩子之前，我也有过这种平静的时刻，但很少。有了孩子之后，一天能有好几次。</p><p>My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn’t realize there were good times too. </p><p>我对孩子的另一个认知来源是自己的童年，这同样具有误导性。我小时候很调皮，总因为各种事被找麻烦。所以在我看来，为人父母本质上就是 “执法”—— 我从没想过，原来也有快乐的时候。</p><p>I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she’d really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth. </p><p>记得 30 岁左右时，母亲曾对我说，她真的很享受养育我和妹妹的过程。当时我心想：天啊，这女人简直是圣人。她不仅忍受了我们带来的所有麻烦，竟然还觉得享受？现在我才明白，她只是在说真话。</p><p>She said that one reason she liked having us was that we’d been interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids. You don’t just love them. They become your friends too. They’re really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty times) it’s often genuinely fun to play with them. That surprised me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does. </p><p>她说喜欢养我们的一个原因是，和我们聊天很有意思。有了孩子后，这一点让我很意外：你不只是爱他们，他们还会成为你的朋友。他们真的很有趣。虽然我承认，小孩子对重复有种要命的执念（但凡值得做一次的事，就值得做五十次），但和他们玩常常是真的开心。这也让我意外：我两岁时和两岁的孩子玩很开心，六岁时就觉得无趣了，为什么长大后反而又觉得好玩了呢？但事实就是这样。</p><p>There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still, terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience that are hard to imagine unless you’ve had them. But it is not, as I implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for the lifeboats. </p><p>当然，育儿也有纯粹枯燥的时候，甚至可怕的时刻。有孩子是一种极致的体验，没经历过的人很难想象。但它不像我之前默认的那样，只是 “DNA 在找救生艇”（指繁衍后代只是基因的本能）。</p><p>Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you’re going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you’re going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I’m not sure if it’s because that’s how kids are, or because it’s the only way to integrate their lives with adults’, but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule. </p><p>不过，我之前对有孩子的一些担忧是对的。他们确实会降低你的生产力。我知道有些人为了孩子会 “振作起来”，但如果你的生活本就有条理，那你能用来做事的时间会变少。尤其是，你得按时间表来。孩子有他们的作息 —— 不确定是因为孩子本身就这样，还是因为这是让他们的生活和成人生活融合的唯一方式 —— 但有了孩子后，你往往得按他们的时间表来。</p><p>You will have chunks of time to work. But you can’t let work spill promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had kids. You’re going to have to work at the same time every day, whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be times when you have to stop, even if it is. </p><p>你还是会有整块的工作时间，但不能像以前那样，让工作随心所欲地填满生活。你得每天在固定时间工作，不管有没有灵感；也总会有不得不停下的时候，哪怕灵感正盛。</p><p>I’ve been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens at those times. So while I don’t get as much done as before I had kids, I get enough done. </p><p>我已经适应了这样的工作方式。工作和爱一样，总会找到出路。如果只有特定时间能做事，那就在那些时间做。所以虽然我做的事比没孩子时少，但也足够了。</p><p>I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But if there weren’t something real there, why would I squirm? The fact is, once you have kids, you’re probably going to care more about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum game. Only one idea at a time can be the top idea in your mind. Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it will less often be some project you’re working on. </p><p>这话我不想说，因为 “有野心” 一直是我身份的一部分，但有孩子可能会让人没那么有野心。写下这句话时，我都觉得别扭，想回避。但如果这不是事实，我何必回避呢？事实是，有了孩子后，你可能会更在乎他们，胜过在乎自己。而注意力是零和游戏 —— 脑子里一次只能有一个最重要的念头。有了孩子后，这个念头常常是他们，所以你放在工作项目上的心思就会少些。</p><p>I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when I write essays, I think about what I’d want my kids to know. That drives me to get things right. And when I was writing Bel, I told my kids that once I finished it I’d take them to Africa. When you say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise. Which meant I had to finish or I’d be taking away their trip to Africa. Maybe if I’m really lucky such tricks could put me net ahead. But the wind is there, no question. </p><p>我有一些小技巧来应对这种情况。比如写文章时，我会想 “这是我想让孩子知道的事”，这会推动我把事情做好。写《贝尔》时，我跟孩子们说，写完就带他们去非洲。跟小孩子说这种话，他们会当真的 —— 这意味着我必须写完，不然就会剥夺他们的非洲之旅。也许运气好的话，这些技巧能让我总体上不输以前。但那种 “野心被稀释” 的趋势，确实存在。</p><p>On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it won’t survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare? </p><p>但反过来想：如果你的野心连有孩子都承受不住，那它也太脆弱了吧？你就这么 “输不起” 吗？</p><p>And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn’t overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the ability to take off for some other country at a moment’s notice. That was so great. Why did I never do that? </p><p>虽然有孩子可能扭曲了我现在的判断，但它没抹去我的记忆。我清楚记得没孩子时的生活，清楚到会很想念一些事，比如随时能出发去别的国家。那多棒啊，我以前怎么没多做呢？</p><p>See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used it. </p><p>发现了吗？事实是，没孩子时拥有的那些自由，我大多都没利用过。我为它付出了孤独的代价，却从未真正使用过。</p><p>I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments, there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it on tap, almost any bedtime. </p><p>没孩子时，我有过很多快乐的时光。但如果数 “快乐的时刻”—— 不只是潜在的快乐，而是真实的快乐瞬间 —— 有孩子之后比之前多。现在，几乎每个哄睡的时刻，我都能感受到这种快乐，触手可及。</p><p>People’s experiences as parents vary a lot, and I know I’ve been lucky. But I think the worries I had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other parents’ faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that kids bring.     </p><p>为人父母的体验因人而异，我知道自己很幸运。但我觉得，我之前对有孩子的担忧应该很普遍；而从其他父母看到孩子时的神情来看，孩子带来的快乐，大概也同样普遍。</p><p>Note </p><p>[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.</p><p>[1] 成年人足够成熟，能发现两岁孩子身上那种迷人的复杂性，把他们看作独一无二的鲜活个体；而对大多数六岁孩子来说，两岁的小孩不过是 “发育不完全的六岁孩子” 罢了。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Do-Great-Work"><a href="#How-to-Do-Great-Work" class="headerlink" title="How to Do Great Work"></a>How to Do Great Work</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html</a></p><p>译文链接 [赛博禅心]: <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/31iL-Kbs4KrqpgrERVRNzQ">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/31iL-Kbs4KrqpgrERVRNzQ</a></p><h3 id="一、成就伟大事业的关键"><a href="#一、成就伟大事业的关键" class="headerlink" title="一、成就伟大事业的关键"></a>一、成就伟大事业的关键</h3><p>If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it.</p><p>Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it’s not just a point labelled “work hard.”</p><p>The following recipe assumes you’re very ambitious.</p><p>如果让你收集在不同领域成就伟大事业的技巧列表，它们的交集会是什么呢？我决定通过实践来找出答案。</p><p>我的目标有两个，其一是创建一个可以为所有领域的从业者所用的指南，其二是我也对交集的形态感到好奇 —— 实践表明，这个交集确实有一个「明确的形状」，它不仅仅是一个标有「努力工作」字样的点。</p><p><strong>以下指南的前提假设是你拥有雄心壮志。</strong></p><h4 id="第一步：决定要做什么"><a href="#第一步：决定要做什么" class="headerlink" title="第一步：决定要做什么"></a>第一步：决定要做什么</h4><p>The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: </p><ul><li>it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, </li><li>that you have a deep interest in, </li><li>and that offers scope to do great work.</li></ul><p>**第一步是决定要做什么。**你所选择的工作需要具有三个特质：</p><ol><li>你对这件事有天赋；</li><li>你对这件事有深深的兴趣；</li><li>这件事拥有取得杰出成就的空间。</li></ol><p>In practice you don’t have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. [1]</p><p>在实践中，我们不必过于担心第三点 —— 对于具有雄心壮志的人来说，可见的空间已然过于保守 —— 所以<strong>我们需要做的就是找到有天赋和极大兴趣的事情。</strong>[1]</p><p>That sounds straightforward, but it’s often quite difficult. When you’re young you don’t know what you’re good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.</p><p>这听起来很简单，但往往很困难。当我们年轻时，并不知道自己擅长什么，或者不同类型的工作是什么样的，甚至我们最终做的一些工作可能当前还不存在。所以，虽然有些人在十四岁的时候就知道他们想做什么，但大多数人还需要时间去弄清楚。</p><p>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you’re not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You’ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that’s fine. It’s good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.</p><p>找出要做什么的方法是通过工作。如果我们不确定要做什么，那就猜，但是要选择一件事情并开始做。我们可能会猜错，但没关系，了解多种事物是好的 —— <strong>一些最伟大的发现来自于注意到不同领域之间的联系</strong>。</p><p>Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don’t let “work” mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you’ll be driving your part of it.</p><p><strong>养成自己发起并推动项目的习惯</strong>。不要让「工作」这个词等同于别人告诉我们要做什么事情。如果我们有一天真的取得了杰出成就，那可能会始于我们自己发起的一个项目 —— 它可能包含在某个更大的项目中，但你会推动其中的一部分。</p><p>What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you’re starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.</p><p>我们的项目应该是什么？任何令自己感到兴奋的且可以让自己踌躇满志的事。随着年龄的增长，我们对项目的品味会进化，兴奋程度和重要性会趋于正相关 —— 七岁时，用乐高搭建巨大的模型可能看起来令人兴奋且斗志满满；十四岁时，可能是自学微积分；二十一岁时，则可能是开始探索物理学中的未解问题 —— 但，无论是什么，它们始终是令人兴奋的。</p><p>There’s a kind of excited curiosity that’s both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.</p><p>伴随着兴奋的好奇心是杰出成就的引擎和舵，它不仅会驱动我们前进，如果我们能让它发挥更大的作用，它还会告诉我们要做什么。</p><p>What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That’s what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>我们对什么有着「过分的」好奇心，「过分」到其他大多数人会觉得无聊的程度？那就是我们所要寻找的事。</strong></p><h4 id="第二步：学习足够多的知识"><a href="#第二步：学习足够多的知识" class="headerlink" title="第二步：学习足够多的知识"></a>第二步：学习足够多的知识</h4><p>Once you’ve found something you’re excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.</p><p>一旦找到了「过分」感兴趣的事，下一步就是学习足够多的知识，让我们能够到达此领域的知识前沿。知识以分形的方式扩展，从远处看，它的边缘看起来很平滑，但一旦我们学习得足够多，接近其中的部分边缘，会发现它们充满了缺口。</p><h4 id="第三步：关注所属领域的”缺口”"><a href="#第三步：关注所属领域的”缺口”" class="headerlink" title="第三步：关注所属领域的”缺口”"></a>第三步：关注所属领域的”缺口”</h4><p>The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted. [2]</p><p>下一步是注意到这些缺口。这需要一些技巧，因为我们的大脑想要忽略这些缺口，以便构建一个更简单的世界模型。许多伟大的发现来自于对大家都视为理所当然的事提出问题。[2]</p><p>If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.</p><p>如果答案看起来很奇怪，那就更好了 —— 杰出成就往往带有奇特色彩 —— 从绘画到数学，我们都可以看到这一点。试图制造这种奇特的行为是做作的，但如果它出现了，就接受它。</p><h4 id="第四步：探索其中有前景的缺口"><a href="#第四步：探索其中有前景的缺口" class="headerlink" title="第四步：探索其中有前景的缺口"></a>第四步：探索其中有前景的缺口</h4><p>Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren’t interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren’t. If you’re excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they’re all overlooking, that’s as good a bet as you’ll find. [3]</p><p><strong>大胆地追求不合群的想法，即使其他人对它们不感兴趣</strong> —— 事实上，尤其是他们不感兴趣的时候。如果我们对大家都忽视的某种可能性感到兴奋，并且有足够的专业知识来精确地说出他们都忽视了什么，那就是我们能找到的最好的赌注。[3]</p><p>Four steps: </p><ul><li>choose a field, </li><li>learn enough to get to the frontier, </li><li>notice gaps, </li><li>explore promising ones.</li></ul><p>四个步骤：</p><ol><li>选择一个领域；</li><li>学习足够多的知识以到达领域前沿；</li><li>注意到领域缺口；</li><li>探索其中有前景的缺口。</li></ol><p>This is how practically everyone who’s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.</p><p>—— 这就是几乎所有取得杰出成就的人都是如何做到的，从画家到物理学家。</p><p>Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That’s why it’s essential to work on something you’re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.</p><p>第二步和第四步需要努力。我可能无法用语言证明一个人必须努力才能取得伟大成就，但实证证据就像死亡的证据一样确凿。这就是为什么我们必须从事自己深感兴趣的事情 —— 兴趣会驱使我们比单纯的勤奋工作更加努力。</p><p>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.</p><p>The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there’s a whole world inside.</p><p><strong>三个最强大的内在动机是好奇心、快乐和做出令人印象深刻的事情的欲望，当它们会汇聚在一起时，会成为最强大的组合。</strong></p><p>最大的奖励是发现一个新的分形芽。我们注意到了知识表面的一个裂缝，撬开它，里面有一个完整的世界。</p><h3 id="二、找出自己要做的事"><a href="#二、找出自己要做的事" class="headerlink" title="二、找出自己要做的事"></a>二、找出自己要做的事</h3><p>Let’s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it’s hard is that you can’t tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you’re not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information. [4]</p><p>我们多讨论一些关于弄清楚要做什么这个复杂的问题。其中，主要困难在于，除了做过的工作，我们无法知道大多数类型的工作是什么样的，这意味着前面所说的四个步骤是重叠的：我们可能需要花几年的时间做某件事，才能知道自己有多喜欢它或者我们在这方面有多好；同时，我们没有在做大多数其他类型的工作，也就没有在学习。所以在最坏的情况下，我们会在不正确的时机且信息非常不完整的情况下做出选择。[4]</p><p>The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.</p><p>雄心壮志的性质加剧了这个问题。雄心壮志有两种形式：一种是在对工作感兴趣之前就有的，另一种是在工作过程中生长出来的。取得伟大成就的大多数人的雄心都是混合的，但前者越少，就会越难决定要做什么。</p><p>The educational systems in most countries pretend it’s easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it’s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.</p><p>大多数国家的教育系统都假装决定要做什么很容易，他们期望我们在知道某个领域真正是什么样子之前就做出决定。因此，<strong>沿着最佳轨迹来看，一个有雄心壮志的人往往会被系统视为异类。</strong></p><p>It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can’t do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you’ll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don’t tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you’re on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.</p><p>如果这些系统至少承认这一点就好了 —— 系统不仅不能帮助我们弄清楚要做什么，而且还是在假设我们可以在十几岁的时候神奇地猜出来的基础上设计的。它们不会说，但在这里我要强调：<strong>当涉及到弄清楚要做什么时，我们只能靠自己</strong>。有些人运气好，一下就猜对了，但其他人会发现自己在假设每个人都会在的轨道上歪斜着奔跑。</p><p>What should you do if you’re young and ambitious but don’t know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who’ve done great work, it’s remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. [5]</p><p>如果我们年轻并且有雄心但不知道要做什么，我们应该做什么？我们知道自己不应该被动漂流，假设问题会自己解决，同时我们需要采取行动，但没有可以遵循的系统性程序。当我们阅读取得杰出成就的人的传记时，会发现运气的参与程度是那么高：他们通过偶然的会面，或者读到他们碰巧拿起的一本书，就发现了要做什么。<strong>所以我们需要让自己成为运气的显眼目标，做到这一点的方法是保持好奇 —— 尝试很多事，见很多人，读很多书，问很多问题。</strong>[5]</p><p>When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they’re like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not for you.</p><p>当我们感到疑惑时，优先考虑有趣的事情。随着对它们了解得越多，我们对领域的认知就会发生变化，例如，数学家做的事情与我们在高中数学课上做的事情非常不同 —— 所以我们需要给不同类型的工作一个展示它们是什么样的机会 —— 但是，当我们对一个领域了解得越多，它应该变得越来越有趣，如果没有，那可能就不适合自己。</p><p>Don’t worry if you find you’re interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you’ll be productive. And you’re more likely to find new things if you’re looking where few have looked before.</p><p>如果我们发现自己对其他人不感兴趣的事情感兴趣，不要担心，我们的兴趣越奇特，越好 —— 奇特的往往是强烈的，对工作有强烈的感受意味着我们会有超高的生产力。而且，如果我们在很少有人到达过的地方探索，那就更有可能找到新的东西。</p><p>One sign that you’re suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.</p><p><strong>当我们喜欢其他人感到乏味或恐惧的工作时，这是一个我们适合这份工作的标志。</strong></p><p>But fields aren’t people; you don’t owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that’s more exciting, don’t be afraid to switch.</p><p>但，领域不是人，我们完全不需要对它们保持忠诚。如果在做一件事的过程中，我们发现了另一件更令人兴奋的事，不要害怕切换。</p><p>If you’re making something for people, make sure it’s something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.</p><p>如果我们正在为人们做点东西，要确保它是人们真正想要的。做到这一点的最好方法是做自己想要的东西：写自己想读的故事，制作自己想使用的工具。由于我们的朋友可能有类似的兴趣，这也会为我们带来初始「观众」。</p><p>This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you’re lost. [6]</p><p>这也可以从令人兴奋的规则中得出的 —— 显然，最令人兴奋的故事就是我们自己想读的故事。我特别提到这个例子的原因是，<strong>有很多人在这方面做错了，他们不是制作他们想要的东西，而是试图制作一些想象中的、更成熟的观众想要的东西。一旦我们走上这条路，就迷失了。</strong>[6]</p><p>There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you’re trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people’s wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you’ll be proof against all of them. If you’re interested, you’re not astray.</p><p>当我们试图弄清楚要做什么时，有很多力量会使我们误入歧途：矫饰、趋势、恐惧、金钱、政治、他人的愿望、狡猾的骗子。但如果我们坚持自己真正感兴趣的事情，就能抵御所有这些，如果我们感兴趣，就没有误入歧途。</p><h3 id="三、关于制定计划"><a href="#三、关于制定计划" class="headerlink" title="三、关于制定计划"></a>三、关于制定计划</h3><p>Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.</p><p>追随自己的兴趣可能听起来像是一种相当被动的策略，但在实践中，它通常意味着要跨越各种障碍，我们通常需要冒着被拒绝和失败的风险，所以这确实需要相当大的勇气。</p><p>But while you need boldness, you don’t usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.</p><p>但是，我们虽然需要勇气，但通常不需要太多计划。大多数情况下，成就伟大事业的方式很简单：在令人兴奋的、能够激发我们雄心壮志的项目上努力工作，好的事情就会自然发生 —— <strong>我们不需要制定一个计划然后执行它，只需要维持某些不变量</strong>。</p><p>The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can’t discover natural selection that way.</p><p>计划的问题在于，它只适用于可以提前描述的成就。我们可以决定赢得金牌或者变得富有，然后坚持追求这个目标，但不能以这种方式实现自然选择。</p><p>I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach “staying upwind.” This is how most people who’ve done great work seem to have done it.</p><p>我认为，对于大多数想要取得伟大成就的人来说，正确的策略是不要计划太多。在每个阶段，做任何看起来最有趣并为未来提供最好选择的事，我称这种方法为「保持上风」—— 这似乎就是大多数伟大成就如何达成的。</p><h3 id="四、工作推进的策略技巧"><a href="#四、工作推进的策略技巧" class="headerlink" title="四、工作推进的策略技巧"></a>四、工作推进的策略技巧</h3><p>Even when you’ve found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren’t like that.</p><p>即使我们找到了令人兴奋的工作，进行这项工作也并不总是简单的。有时候，一些新的想法会让我们早上从床上跳起来，直接开始工作，但也有很多时候，事情恰恰相反。</p><p>You don’t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there’s a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.</p><p>我们不能只是张开帆，让灵感把自己推向前方，会有逆风、潮汐和隐藏的暗礁。所以，<strong>工作就像航行一样，是有技巧的</strong>。</p><p>For example, while you must work hard, it’s possible to work too hard, and if you do that you’ll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.</p><p>例如，我们虽然必须努力工作，但是也有可能工作过度，在这种状态下，我们会发现收益递减：疲劳会让我们变得愚蠢，最终甚至可能损害我们的健康。工作产生递减收益的点取决于工作的类型，一些最艰难的类型，我们可能一天只能做四五个小时。</p><p>Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You’ll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.</p><p>理想情况下，这些工时应该是连续的。尽可能地，试着安排自己的生活，让自己有大块的时间来工作，如果知道可能会被打断，那就回避艰难的任务。</p><p>It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You’ll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don’t worry about this; it’s the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it’s higher than the energy required to keep going, it’s ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.</p><p>开始工作可能比继续工作更难，你经常需要欺骗自己，才能越过初始门槛。不要担心，这是工作的性质，不是你性格中的缺陷。工作需要一种「激活能量」，每天，以及每个项目都有，但因为它比继续前进所需的能量高，这个门槛可以被视作是假的，所以可以对自己适度撒个谎来越过它。</p><p>It’s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn’t. When I’m reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying “I’ll just read over what I’ve got so far.” Five minutes later I’ve found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I’m off.</p><p>如果我们想取得伟大成就，对自己撒谎通常是错的，但有少数几个例外。每当早上不愿意开始工作时，我经常欺骗自己说：「我只是看看自己到目前为止做了什么。」五分钟后，我发现了一些看起来错误或不完整的东西，就开始工作了。</p><p>Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It’s ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying “How hard could it be?”</p><p>类似的技巧适用于开始新的项目。在预估项目所需的工作量时，向自己撒谎是可以的，<strong>许多伟大事业都是从某人说「这有什么难的？」开始的</strong>。</p><p>This is one case where the young have an advantage. They’re more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.</p><p>这是年轻人有优势的例子之一 —— 他们更乐观 —— 尽管他们乐观的部分来源是无知，但在这种情况下，无知有时可以打败渊博。</p><p>Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.</p><p>尽管如此，我们要尽量完成己经开始的事情，即使它比预期的工作量要多很多。完成一件事不仅是整洁或自律的练习，在许多项目中，最佳成就点处于本应是最后阶段的地方。</p><p>Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you’re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all. [7]</p><p>另一个可以撒谎的点是在自己心中夸大我们正在做的事情的重要性。如果这有助于我们发现新的东西，那么它可能最终并不是一个谎言。[7]</p><p>Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn’t quite right. When you’re procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. [8]</p><p>由于「开始工作」的有两种定义 —— 每天和每个项目 —— 所以也有两种形式的拖延，<strong>以项目为单位的拖延远比以天为单位的拖延更危险</strong> —— 我们把开始那个雄心勃勃的项目推迟了一年又一年，因为时间还不够 —— 当以年为单位计算时，我们可以做很多事情。[8]</p><p>One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You’re not just sitting around doing nothing; you’re working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn’t set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You’re too busy to notice it.</p><p>项目的拖延之所以如此危险，其中一个原因是它通常会伪装成「工作」。我们不是坐在那里什么都不做，而是在其他事情上勤奋地工作。所以，项目的拖延不会像日期的拖延一样，触发拖延的警报 —— 我们太忙了，注意不到它。</p><p>The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you’re young it’s ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older. [9]</p><p>**打败项目拖延的方法是偶尔停下来问自己：「我正在做我最想做的事吗？」**年轻的时候，如果答案有时是「不」，那是可以的，但随着年龄的增长，这会变得越来越危险。[9]</p><p>Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can’t think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it’s happening.</p><p>**杰出的成就通常需要我们在一个问题上花费大多数人认为超出了合理范围的大量时间。**我们不能把这个时间看作是成本，否则它会显得太高，我们必须在工作过程中找到足够的吸引力。</p><p>There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you’re genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you’re surprised how far you’ve come.</p><p>有一些工作，我们可能必须在自己讨厌的事情上努力工作数年，才能接近喜欢的部分，但这不是杰出成就产生的方式，杰出的成就是通过持续关注自己真正感兴趣的事情来实现的 —— 当我们停下来盘点时，会惊讶于自己已经走了多远。</p><p>The reason we’re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn’t sound like much, but if you do it every day you’ll write a book a year. That’s the key: consistency. People who do great things don’t get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.</p><p>我们往往会低估工作的累积效应。每天写一页字不算什么，但如果我们每天都这样做，一年就能写一本书 —— <strong>这就是关键：一致性</strong> —— 取得杰出成就的人并不是每天都做很多事情，他们只做一些事情，而不是什么都不做。</p><p>If you do work that compounds, you’ll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it’s worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they’ll bring you.</p><p>**如果我们做的工作有叠加效应，那么我们就会收获指数增长，**大多数在做此类工作的人都是无意识的，但这值得我们停下来认真思考。例如，学习就是这种现象的一个例子：我们对某件事了解得越多，学习更多的事情就越容易。「观众」的增长也是如此：我们的粉丝越多，他们就会为我们带来更多的新粉丝。</p><p>The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn’t; it’s still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can’t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.</p><p>指数增长的问题在于，曲线在开始时给人的感觉很平。但它不是，它仍然是一个美妙的指数曲线，只是我们无法直观地理解这一点，所以我们低估了指数增长的早期阶段。</p><p>Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it’s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.</p><p>一件可以指数增长的事可以变得非常有价值，值得我们付出特别的努力去启动。但由于我们在早期低估了指数增长，这也主要是无意识地完成的：人们在学习新事物的初始且无回报的阶段中坚持下去，因为他们从经验中知道学习新事物总是需要一个初始的推动力，或者他们一个一个地增加他们的「观众」，因为他们没有更好的事可做 —— 如果人们意识到他们可以投资于指数增长，会有更多的人去做。</p><p>Work doesn’t just happen when you’re trying to. There’s a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you’ll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.</p><p>工作不仅仅在我们努力时发生的。当我们散步、洗澡或躺在床上时，会进行一种无明确目标的思考，这种思考可能非常有力量。<strong>通过让思绪稍微漫游一下，我们经常能够解决那些无法通过正面攻击解决的问题</strong>。</p><p>You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can’t just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions. [10]</p><p>然而，我们必须是在以正确的方式努力工作前提下，才能从这种现象中获益。我们不能只是四处游荡做白日梦。这种漫无目的的思考必须与有意识的工作交替进行，工作会引导我们思考问题。[10]</p><p>Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it’s also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you’ll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don’t avoid love.)</p><p>每个人都知道在工作时要避免分心，但在周期的另一半避免分心也很重要。每当我们的思绪发散时，它会漫游向我们那一刻最关心的事情上。所以，要避免让会将工作挤出首位的事分散自己的注意力，否则我们会把这种宝贵的思考方式用在分心上（例外情况：不要回避爱情！）。</p><p>Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don’t know what you’re aiming for.</p><p>**有意识地培养对自己领域工作的品味。**除非我们知道什么是最好的，以及是什么使它成为最好的，否则我们并不知道自己在追求什么。</p><p>And that is what you’re aiming for, because if you don’t try to be the best, you won’t even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it’s true. </p><ul><li><p>It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. </p></li><li><p>Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. </p></li><li><p>Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard.</p></li></ul><p>Probably all three are true. [11]</p><p>这就是我们所应追求的，因为如果我们不努力成为最好的，我们甚至都做不好。这一观察已经被许多不同领域的人指出了，所以这可能值得我们思考一下为什么会这样：</p><ol><li>可能是因为实现雄心壮志的途中有这样一种现象，几乎所有的错误都偏向一方 —— <strong>几乎所有未击中目标的炮弹都是落得不够远；</strong></li><li>可能是因为追求做到最好的雄心壮志与追求做好的抱负有着质的不同；</li><li>可能与「最好」不同，「好」只是一个过于模糊的标准。</li></ol><p>—— 这三个可能都是真的。[11]</p><p>Fortunately there’s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you’d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It’s exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it’s easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.</p><p>幸运的是，这里也存在规模经济。虽然努力做到最好可能看起来会为我们增加很大的负担，但实际上我们经常会得到净收益。这是令人兴奋的，也是一种奇妙的解放，事情被简化了 —— 在某些方面，努力做到最好比仅仅努力做好更容易。</p><p>One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries’, but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.</p><p>追求高目标的方法之一是试图创造一些人们在一百年后还会关心的东西。并不是因为他们的观点比我们同时代的人更重要，而是因为<strong>一百年后仍然看起来不错的东西更有可能是真正好的东西。</strong></p><h3 id="五、真诚的表达自己与面对问题"><a href="#五、真诚的表达自己与面对问题" class="headerlink" title="五、真诚的表达自己与面对问题"></a>五、真诚的表达自己与面对问题</h3><p>Don’t try to work in a distinctive style.

Trying to is affectation.</p><p>风格是在不刻意为之的情况下以独特的方式做事，刻意为之则是矫饰。</p><p>Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you’re pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work. [12]</p><p>矫饰实际上是假装工作的人不是自己，我们采用了一个令人印象深刻但虚假的人格。虽然我们可能会为给他人留下深刻印象感到满足，但工作中表现出来的是一种假人格。[12]</p><p>The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it’s self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you’re not a nobody; you’re the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.</p><p>年轻人最容易受到「成为他人」的诱惑，他们经常自认为是无名小卒。但永远不需要担心这个问题，因为如果我们持续做足够有前景的项目，这个问题就会逐渐自我消解。如果成功地完成了一个伟大的项目，我们就不是无名小卒，而是完成它的人。所以，只要工作，我们的身份就会自己变好。</p><p>“Avoid affectation” is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you’re earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices.</p><p>「避免矫饰」是个有用的规则，这需要长期坚持，但我们如何用积极的方式表达自己的想法呢？我们如何说出要成为什么，而不是不要成为什么呢？最好的答案是真诚。如果我们是真诚的，那就不仅可以避免矫饰，还可以避免一整套类似的恶习。</p><p>The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We’re taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it’s a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You’re trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you’re intellectually dishonest?</p><p>真诚的核心是诚实。我们从小就被教导要诚实，作为一种无私的美德 —— 作为一种牺牲。但事实上，它是一种力量的来源，要看到新的想法，我们需要对真相异常敏锐。假设我们正在试图看到比其他人到目前为止看到的更多的真相，如果我们在智力上不诚实，又怎么能对真相有敏锐的眼光呢？</p><p>One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you’re mistaken. Once you’ve admitted you were mistaken about something, you’re free. Till then you have to carry it. [13]</p><p>保持智力诚实（Intellectual Honesty）的一种方法是保持轻微的正压。愿意积极承认自己的错误 —— 一旦我们承认自己在某件事上犯了错误，就自由了 —— 在这之前，我们必须承担它。[13]</p><p>Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It’s not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn’t.</p><p>真诚的另一个更微妙的组成部分是不拘小节。「不拘小节」比它的语法层面所暗示的要重要得多，<strong>它不仅仅意味着少做某些事，还意味着关注重要的事情，而不是无关的事情。</strong></p><p>What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you’re trying to seem a certain way as you’re doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That’s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that’s basically the definition of a nerd.</p><p>拘泥于形式和矫饰的共同点是，你在做工作的同时，也试图以某种方式伪装。但任何投入到「表面功夫」中能量都会被从做重要的事情中分走。这就是为什么书呆子在做伟大的工作上有优势的一个原因：他们在表面功夫上花费的努力很小。事实上，这基本上就是书呆子的定义。</p><p>Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that’s exactly what you need in doing great work. It’s not learned; it’s preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. “It’s easy to criticize” is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.</p><p>书呆子有一种天真的大胆，这正是你在做伟大的工作时所需要的。它不是学来的；它是从童年保留下来的，所以要保持它。<strong>成为那个把事情做出来的人，而不是坐在背后提供复杂的批评的人。</strong>「批评很容易」在最字面的意义上是真的，而取得伟大成就的路永远不容易。</p><p>There may be some jobs where it’s an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it’s an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you’ll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There’s an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it’s better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that’s advice for seeming smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it’s better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.</p><p>可能有一些工作，悲观是一个优势，但如果我们想去的杰出成就，乐观是一个优势，即便这意味着我们有时会冒看起来像一个傻瓜的风险。旧传统指导我们做相反的事，《旧约圣经》说：最好保持安静，以免看起来像一个傻瓜 —— 但这是为了看起来聪明的建议，如果我们真的想发现新的东西，最好冒险告诉人们自己的想法。</p><p>Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It’s so hard to do even if you are. You don’t have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool. [14]</p><p>有些人天生就是真诚的，有些人需要有意识的努力，任何一种真诚都足够。但我怀疑，**如果没有真诚，就不可能做出伟大的工作，而且即使我们是真诚的，也很难做到。**我们没有足够的误差边际来容纳被影响、智力上的不诚实、拘泥于形式、流行或酷带来的现实扭曲。[14]</p><p>Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It’s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.</p><p>优秀的作品不仅与创作者保持一致，也与作品本身保持一致。通常而言，优秀的作品都是成体系的 —— 所以，如果我们在工作中面临抉择，问问自己哪个选择更有一致性。</p><p>You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won’t necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there’s something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I’d already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?</p><p>我们可能不得不放弃一些事情并重新开始，我们不一定必须这样做，但我们必须愿意这样做，这可能需要一些努力。当我们需要重做一些事情时，对维持现状的倾向性和懒惰会联合起来让我们否认这个想法。为了克服这个问题，问问自己：如果我已经做了改变，我是否想要恢复现在的状态？</p><p>Have the confidence to cut.

A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn’t expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don’t know what the benefit will be.</p><p>同样，如果我们试图构建一个强大的工具，那要让它尽可能地无限制。一个强大的工具会以我们没有预料到的方式被使用 —— 这几乎可以算作强大工具的定义，所以要倾向于消除限制，即使你不知道这样做会有什么好处。</p><p>Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it’s a good sign if you’re creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.

Originality isn’t a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can’t help it.</p><p>我从未喜欢过「创新过程」这个词，它似乎有些误导性。原创不是一个过程，而是一种思维习惯。原创的思想家，无论他们关注的是什么，都会产生新的想法，就像角磨机抛出火花一样，没有人可以控制这种现象的发生。</p><p>If the thing they’re focused on is something they don’t understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced.

For example, you’re much more likely to have original ideas when you’re working on something. Original ideas don’t come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult. [15]</p><p>我不知道原创性是否可以被培养出来，但肯定有方法可以最大限度地利用自己所拥有的。例如，当我们在工作时，更有可能产生原创想法。原创想法并不来自于刻意的尝试，而是来自于尝试构建或理解稍微困难的东西。[15]</p><p>Talking or writing about the things you’re interested in is a good way to generate new ideas.

If you visit a new place, you’ll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.

Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that.

Once you’ve seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?</p><p>拥有新想法是一种奇怪的游戏，因为通常它还包括看到那些就在我们眼前的东西。一旦我们看到一个新的想法，它往往显得很明显 —— 为什么之前没有人想到这个？</p><p>When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it’s probably a good one.</p><p><strong>当一个想法看起来既新颖又显而易见时，它可能是个好主意。</strong></p><p>Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What’s the source of this apparent contradiction? It’s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That’s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they’re easy to see after you do something hard.</p><p>看到显而易见的东西听起来很容易，然而，从经验上看，产生新想法是困难的，这个明显矛盾的源头是什么呢？那就是看到新的想法通常需要我们改变看世界的方式。我们通过模型看世界，这些模型既帮助着我们，也限制着我们，在修复有问题的世界模型的过程中，新的想法会变得显而易见，但注意到并修复一个有问题的模型是困难的，这就是新的想法既明显又难以发现的原因。在你做了一些困难的事情之后，它们就容易被看到。</p><p>One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don’t want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they’re attached to their current model; it’s what they think in; so they’ll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.</p><p>发现有问题的世界模型的方法之一是比其他人更严谨。有问题的模型在与现实发生冲突时会留下一些迹象，但大多数人不想看到这些迹象。保守的说法是，人们倾向于依赖于他们当前的模型，这就是他们的思维方式，所以他们倾向于忽略模型出现问题时留下的线索，无论这在反思中看起来多么明显。</p><p>To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That’s what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell’s equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.</p><p>要找到新的想法，我们必须抓住这些迹象，而不是避而不见。这就是爱因斯坦做的，他能看到麦克斯韦方程的伟大意义，不是因为他在寻找新的想法，而是因为他更严谨。</p><p>The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who’s comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.</p><p>**我们所要做的另一件事是愿意打破规则。**虽然这听起来矛盾，但如果我们想修正自己的世界模型，那么成为一个习惯于打破规则的人会有所帮助。从旧模型的观点来看，这个模型通常至少会违反隐含的规则，包括我们自己最初也是这么认为的。</p><p>Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you’re using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn’t at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.</p><p>很少有人了解打破规则所需的程度，因为新的想法在成功后看起来更保守。一旦我们使用了新的世界模型，它们会看起来完全合理，但开始的时候并不是这样的，地心模型在天文学家中被普遍接受甚至都花了近一个世纪，在这期间，所有人都觉得它错的离谱。</p><p>Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you’re looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can’t with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they’re rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.</p><p>实际上，如果我们思考一下会发现，一个好的新想法必须对大多数人来说看起来是坏的，否则就已经有人探索过了。所以**我们在寻找的是那些看起来疯狂，但是正确类别的疯狂想法。**我们如何识别他们呢？不能确定。通常看起来不好的想法就是不好的，但是，正确类别的疯狂想法往往是令人兴奋的，它们富有意蕴，而单纯的坏想法往往会让人感到沮丧。</p><p>There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.</p><p><strong>有两种方式可以让我们自然而然地打破规则：享受打破规则本身，或干脆无视规则 —— 我将它们分别称为积极和被动独立思考。</strong></p><p>The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don’t merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.</p><p>积极独立思考的是那些叛逆的人。规则不仅无法阻止他们，打破规则还会给他们额外的能量。对这类人来说，一个项目的纯粹胆大有时就可以提供足够的「激活能量」让它启动。</p><p>The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field’s assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.</p><p>打破规则的另一种方式是不关心甚至不知道它们的存在 —— 这就是为什么新手和外行人经常做出新发现，他们对所在领域既有假设的无知可以作为一种暂时的被动独立思考的来源。自闭症患者似乎也对常规信条有着免疫力，我认识的几个人说这帮助他们有新的想法。</p><p>Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they’re opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking are opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.</p><p>「严谨 + 打破规则」听起来像是一个奇怪的组合。在主流文化中，他们是对立的，但在这方面，主流文化的模型是有问题的，它默认假设问题都是琐碎的，而在琐碎的事情中，严谨和打破规则确实是对立的，但<strong>在真正重要的问题中，只有打破规则的人才是真正严谨的。</strong></p><p>An overlooked idea often doesn’t lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.</p><p>一个被主流文化忽视的想法通常直到半决赛才败下阵来。我们在潜意识中看到了它，然而潜意识的另一部分会击败它，因为它太奇怪、太冒险、太麻烦、太有争议。但这隐含了一个令人兴奋的可能性：我们如果能关闭这些过滤器，就能看到更多的新想法。</p><p>One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for someone else to explore. Then your subconscious won’t shoot them down to protect you.</p><p>做到这一点的方式之一是问自己：什么是别人认为的好想法？这样我们的潜意识就不会为了自我保护而否决他们。</p><p>You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what’s obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.</p><p>我们也可以从掩盖它们的事物着手，来发现被忽视的想法。每个被珍视的错误原则周围，都存在一片有价值但因为它们与原则相矛盾而未被探索的想法的栖息地。</p><p>Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type. [18]</p><p>宗教是被珍视但错误原则的集合。所以无论是字面意义上或隐喻地，任何被描述为宗教的东西的阴影之下都存在有价值的但未被探索的想法，哥白尼和达尔文都做出了此类发现。[18]</p><p>What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?</p><p><strong>在我们所在的领域，人们对什么规则过分依赖，以至于它们可能不像公认的那般可以自证其是？如果我们抛弃这个原则，会有什么可能性？</strong></p><p>People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who’d never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.</p><p>人们在解决问题上所表现出的原创性远超在决定要解决哪些问题上。即使是最聪明的人，在决定要做什么时也可能惊人地保守，那些在其他任何方面都不会想要赶时髦的人也会被吸入到处理「时兴问题」的漩涡中。</p><p>One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They’re not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.</p><p>问题需要我们下大赌注，这也是人们选择问题比解决问题更保守的原因之一。一个问题可能伴随我们好几年的时间，而探索一个解决方案可能只需要几天。但即便如此，我认为大多数人都过于保守，他们不仅仅是在回避风险，也在迎合潮流，不流行的问题被低估了。</p><p>One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn’t. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you’re interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don’t let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.</p><p>最有趣的一类不流行问题是那些人们认为已经完全探索过，但实际上并没有的。**杰出的成就往往源于已经存在的东西，但问题发现者深入探索并展现了其更多潜力，**杜勒尔和瓦特都做到了这一点。所以，如果我们对别人认为已经被充分探索的领域感兴趣，不要让他们的怀疑阻挡我们，人们往往会在这方面犯错。</p><p>Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There’s no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there’s a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.</p><p>解决不流行的问题可能会非常愉快，工作过程中没有炒作或忙慌。机会主义者和批评者都在别处忙碌，这时我们的工作往往有一种气定神闲的稳定，在努力「培育」这些「否则会被浪费」的想法时，有一种令人满足的经济感。</p><p>But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn’t seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on “important” problems.</p><p>但最常见的被忽视的问题并不是明确地不流行，而是它们并未过时，只是似乎没有它实际上那么重要。我们怎么找到这些呢？通过自我放纵 —— 通过让自己的好奇心有其自由发挥的空间，至少暂时地屏蔽自己脑中那个说我们只应该在「重要」问题上工作的小声音。</p><p>You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there’s an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it’s probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from “serious” work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems.</p><p>我们确实需要将精力放在重要的问题上，但几乎每个人在评价什么算重要问题时都过于保守。而且，如果我们周围有一个重要但被忽视的问题，它可能已经在我们的潜意识雷达中了。所以，试着问自己：**如果我要从「严肃」的工作中抽出时间，只是因为这会非常有趣，我会做什么？**答案可能比看起来更重要。</p><p>Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That’s what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.</p><p>**选择问题的原创性似乎比解决问题的原创性更重要，这是区分那些发现全新领域的人的关键点。**所以，可能看起来只是初步步骤的东西 —— 决定要做什么 —— 在某种意义上是整个游戏的关键。</p><p>Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.</p><p>很少有人能理解这一点。关于新想法的最大的误解之一是关于他们的组成中问题与答案的比例，人们认为重要的部分是答案，但往往真正的洞察在于问题。</p><p>Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they’re used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory.</p><p>我们低估问题的一部分原因是学校的教育方式。在学校里，问题往往只在被解决之前存在一段很短的时间，就像不稳定粒子一样。但一个真正好的问题可以是更多的东西，一个真正好的问题是发现的一部分：新物种是如何产生的？让物体向地球坠落的力量和让行星保持在它们轨道上的力量是同一个吗？通过甚至提出这样的问题，我们已经进入了令人兴奋的新领域。</p><p>Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you’re carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.</p><p>未解决的问题与我们如影随形，会让我们感到负担。但我们带着的问题越多，发现解决方案的机会就越大 —— 或者可能更令人兴奋的是，发现两个未回答的问题是同一个。</p><p>Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn’t stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it’s just as important to keep your youthful questions alive. [19]</p><p>有时候一个问题会伴随我们很长时间。杰出的成就往往出自我们多年前 —— 甚至我们的童年同期 —— 首次注意到的，而且无法停止思考的问题。人们经常谈论保持自己年轻时梦想活跃的重要性，但保持年轻时问题的活跃同样重要。[19]</p><p>This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you’re puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.</p><p>专业知识的实际形态与大众印象最大的区别之一是，**在大众印象中，专家们是胸有成竹的，但实际上，我们越是困惑，越好，**只要（a）我们困惑的事情是重要的，并且（b）没有其他人也理解它们。</p><p>Think about what’s happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you’re willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don’t want to solve them. [20]</p><p>想想新想法被发现的那一刻之前所发生的事，通常情况下，是一个具有足够专业知识的人对某事感到困惑，这意味着困惑是原创性的一部分 —— 混乱！我们必须愿意看到世界充满谜团，对此感到舒适，但也不能那么舒适，以至于不想解决它们。[20]</p><p>It’s a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don’t just lead to answers, but also to more questions.</p><p>拥有很多未解答的问题是一件很棒的事。这也是那些富有的人会变得更富的原因之一，<strong>获得新问题的最好方法是尝试回答现有的问题，问题不仅导向答案，而且也导向更多的问题。</strong></p><p>The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don’t require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It’s hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.</p><p>**最好的问题会在被回答的过程中成长。**我们注意到当前范式中一条显眼的线索，并试图拉扯它，它就会变得越来越长。所以，我们在试图回答问题之前，不要苛求问题的「大」是明确的，我们很少能预测到这一点，仅仅注意到线索就已经很难了，更不用说预测如果我们拉扯它，会有多少东西随之而来。</p><p>It’s better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.</p><p>最好的方法是保持广泛的好奇心 —— 在许多线索上都稍微拉一拉，看看会发生什么。大事物开始时都很小，它们的初始版本通常只是实验、副项目或者演讲，然后逐渐发展成更大的事物 —— 所以，我们应该开始着手做很多小事情。</p><p>Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don’t work. You can’t have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones. [21]</p><p>**高产的作用是被低估的。**我们尝试的事情越多，发现新事物的机会就越大。然而，要知道，尝试很多事也将意味着尝试很多无用的事，我们不能只有很多好主意而没有同样多的坏主意。[21]</p><p>Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that’s been done before, you’ll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you’ll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.</p><p>当我们进入一个领域时，虽然从学习前人的工作成果开始听起来更负责任，但通过尝试，我们会学得更快，也会收获更多的乐趣，而当我们去看前人的工作时，也会更好地理解它们。所以，在初始阶段不要害怕犯错，与此同时，这也意味着我们从小事着手更加容易，这两个想法就像两片相邻的拼图片一般契合。</p><p>How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.</p><p>我们如何从小事开始做出伟大的事情？通过做有连续性的事。伟大的事业几乎总是在一系列连续的工作中被成就的。我们从一些小事开始，逐渐发展它，最后的版本既比我们可能计划的任何东西更好，也更有想象空间。</p><p>It’s particularly useful to make successive versions when you’re making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.</p><p>当我们为人们做东西时，制作连续的版本特别有用 —— 快速地将初始版本呈现给他们，然后根据他们的反应进行演变。</p><p>Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn’t, this will at least get you started.</p><p><strong>试试可能行得通的最简单的东西。出乎意料地，它经常会是有用的，如果没有，至少这会让我们启程。</strong></p><p>Don’t try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle.</p><p>不要试图在任何一个版本中塞进太多的新东西。对此有一些对应的名称，对第一个版本来说是呈现（delivery）花费太长时间，对第二个版本来说是第二系统效应，但这些都只是更具一般性原则的例子。</p><p>An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It’s a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow. [22]</p><p>新项目的早期版本有时会被贬低为玩具。当人们这么做时，这是个好兆头，这意味着它具备新思想所需要的一切，只是缺乏规模，而那往往会随之而来。[22]</p><p>The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you’re going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say “we’re going to do x and then y and then z” than “we’re going to try x and see what happens.” And it is more organized; it just doesn’t work as well.</p><p>从小发展的另一种选择是事先计划我们要做的事情。计划通常看起来是更负责任的选择，说「我们要做 x，然后做 y，然后做 z」听起来比「我们要试试 x，看看会发生什么」似乎更有组织，它确实更有组织，只是效果不那么好。</p><p>Planning per se isn’t good. It’s sometimes necessary, but it’s a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It’s something you have to do because you’re working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don’t have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.</p><p>计划本身并不好，但有时候它是必要的，只是是一种必要的恶 —— 对无情条件的反应。我们必须这么做，因为我们正在使用不灵活的媒介，或者因为我们需要协调很多人的努力，如果我们保持项目小而使用灵活的媒介，就不必计划那么多，我们的设计可以逐步演变。</p><p>Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don’t look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you’re not failing occasionally, you’re probably being too conservative.</p><p>尽可能承担我们负担得起的风险。**在有效市场中，风险与回报成比例，所以不要寻求确定性，而要寻找高期望价值的赌注。**如果我们不失败，偶尔可能是因为过于保守。</p><p>Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it’s the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it’s when you’re young that you can afford the most.</p><p>虽然保守主义通常是老年人的代名词，但年轻人更容易犯这个错误。无经验让他们害怕风险，但实际上，我们年轻的时候承受得起的风险最大。</p><p>Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you’ll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there’s probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.</p><p>即使一个项目失败了，也可以是有价值的。因为在处理它的过程中，我们会穿过很少有人见过的领域，遇到很少有人提出的问题。<strong>试图做一些稍微难一点的事情，在这个过程中遇到的问题可能是全新问题的最好来源。</strong></p><p>Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.</p><p>在我们有年轻人的优势时，使用它们，一旦我们有了有经验的优势，就使用那些。<strong>年轻人的优势是精力、时间、乐观和自由，有经验的优势是知识、效率、金钱和权力 —— 努力工作，我们可以在年轻时获取一些后者，并在经验渐长时保持一些前者。</strong></p><p>The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don’t need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.</p><p>有经验的人的另一个优势是知道自己有哪些优势。年轻人经常意识不到自己所拥有的优势 —— 最大的可能性来自时间，而年轻人对他们在时间上的富足没有任何概念。利用这个时间的最佳方式是以「略微任性」的方式来使用它：只是出于好奇心而去学习我们不需要知道的东西，或者只是因为一件事很酷而试图去建造一些东西，或者让自己变得非常擅长某事。</p><p>That “slightly” is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you’re young, but don’t simply waste it. There’s a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think. [23]</p><p>「略微」是一个重要的修饰词。当我们年轻的时候，可以挥霍时间，但不要简单地浪费它。做一些我们「担心可能是」浪费时间的事情和「确定会」浪费时间的事情之间有很大的区别 —— 前者至少是一次赌注，结果可能比我们认为的更好。[23]</p><p>The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you’re seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don’t fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it’s with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to. [24]</p><p><strong>年轻，或者说无经验的最微妙的优势，就是我们用全新的眼光看待一切</strong>。当我们的大脑第一次接受一个想法时，有时两者并不完全匹配，但通常问题出在我们的大脑上，偶尔在想法上。想法中的一部分突兀地冒出来，在我们思考时刺痛自己，习惯了这个感觉的人已经学会忽视它，但我们有机会不这样做。[24]</p><p>So when you’re learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You’ll be tempted to ignore them, since there’s a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don’t forget about them. When you’ve gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they’re still there. If they’re still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea.</p><p>所以，当我们第一次学习某件事时，要注意那些似乎错误或缺失的东西。我们会被诱惑忽视它们，认为有 99% 的可能性问题在自己身上，并且我们可能必须暂时放下自己的疑虑以继续前进，但不要忘记它们 —— 当我们深入到领域中，再回来检查它们是否依然存在，如果在我们现在的知识水平下，它们仍然是可行的，那么它们可能代表着一个未被发现的想法。</p><p>One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you don’t have to worry about. The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.</p><p>**经验给我们带来的最有价值的知识之一是知道我们不必担心什么。**年轻人知道所有可能的事，但不知道它们的相对重要性，所以他们对所有事情都一样担忧，而我们应该只对几件事情担忧，对其他的事情几乎不需要担忧。</p><p>But what you don’t know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that ain’t so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you’ve acquired and false things you’ve been taught — and you won’t be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.</p><p>但我们的无知只是缺乏经验问题的其中一半，另一半是我们所熟知的那些错误的东西。我们带着满脑子毫无意义的东西进入成年期 —— 已经养成的坏习惯和被教导的错误观念 —— 在清除了至少是在自己想做的工作的路上的噪声前，我们无法取得杰出成就。</p><p>Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We’re so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.</p><p>我们头脑中许多无意义的噪声都是学校留下的。我们习惯于学校，以至于我们无意识地将「去学校」当作「学习」，但实际上学校有各种奇怪的价值观，扭曲了我们对学习和思考的观念。</p><p>For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they’re just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed.</p><p>例如，学校会引导我们进行被动学习。当我们还是小孩子的时候，课堂便利用其权威告诉我们所有人必须学习什么，然后测试我们是否做到了，但是课堂和考试并不是学习的本质，他们只是学校通常设计的产物。</p><p>The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you’re still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it’s not merely some weird thought experiment. It’s the truth economically, and in the best case it’s the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don’t want to be your bosses. They’d prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.</p><p>尽快克服这种被动性越好。如果还在学校，那就试着把教育当作自己的项目，老师是在为自己工作，而不是反过来。这可能看起来有些牵强，但这不仅仅是一种特别的思维实验，从经济上说，这是真的，在最好的情况下，从知识上说也是真的，最好的老师不想做我们的老板。他们宁愿我们推进，用他们作为一个建议的来源，而不是被他们通过材料拉动。</p><p>Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they’re almost always soluble using no more than you’ve been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don’t know if they’re soluble at all.</p><p>学校也给我们工作是什么样的误导性印象。在学校里，他们告诉我们问题是什么，而且几乎总是可以使用我们到目前为止学到的东西来解决。在现实生活中，我们必须找出问题是什么，而且往往不知道它们是否可以解决。</p><p>But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can’t do great work by doing that. You can’t trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.</p><p>但是学校教导我们最糟糕的事情可能就是训练我们通过成为「小镇做题家（hacking the test）」来胜出比赛。我们不能通过这样做取得杰出成就，所以要停止寻找此类捷径，击败系统的方法是专注于其他人忽视的问题和解决方案，而不是偷工减料。</p><p>Don’t think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a “big break.” Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.</p><p><strong>不要依赖某个「看门人」给自己一个「大机会」，即使这是真的，得到它的最好方式是专注于做好工作，而不是追逐有影响力的人。</strong></p><p>And don’t take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they’re part of a feedback loop, and very few are.</p><p>也不要把「委员会」的拒绝放在心上。让招生官员和管理委员会印象深刻的品质与做出伟大工作所需的品质完全不同。选择管理层的决定只有在它们是反馈循环的一部分时才有意义，而很少有决定是这样的</p><p>People new to a field will often copy existing work. There’s nothing inherently bad about that. There’s no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.</p><p>在一个领域里，新手经常会复制已有的工作。这本身并没有什么错，试图复制一件事是学习它是如何运作的最好方式，复制并不一定会使我们的工作失去原创性，<strong>原创性在于新想法的产生，而不是旧想法的缺失。</strong></p><p>There’s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you’re going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what’s meant by the famously misattributed phrase “Great artists steal.” The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that’s done without realizing it, because you’re nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination. [25]</p><p>有好的复制方式，也有坏的。如果我们要复制一些东西，那么公开地去做，而不是偷偷摸摸，或者更糟糕，无意识地去做，这就是那句被误传的名言「伟大的艺术家都是窃贼」的含义。真正危险的复制类型，即给复制带来坏名声的那种，就是我们在不知不觉中做的复制，在这种情况下，我们只不过是在别人铺设的轨道上行驶的列车，但在另一个极端，<strong>复制可以是一种超越的标志，而不是从属关系。</strong>[25]</p><p>In many fields it’s almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people’s. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They’re usually a reaction to previous work. When you’re first starting out, you don’t have any previous work; if you’re going to react to something, it has to be someone else’s. Once you’re established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn’t, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem.</p><p>在很多领域里，我们早期的工作几乎不可避免地在某种程度上是基于他人的。项目很少是凭空产生的，它们通常是对已有工作的反应：刚开始的时候，我们自己没有任何已有工作，如果我们要对某事有反应，那必然是别人的工作，一旦我们有了稳定的地位，就可以对自己的工作有所反应。尽管前者被认为派生的，后者不被认为派生的，但从结构上看，两种情况比看起来更相似。</p><p>Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things, even by their discoverers, because there isn’t yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.</p><p>有时候，足够新颖的、最新奇的想法一开始看起来更加像派生出来的。在最初构想阶段，新的发现通常需要被视为现有事物的变形，甚至他们的发现者也是这样做的，因为还没有对应的概念以及词汇来描述它们。</p><p>There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you’ll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.</p><p>复制确实有些危险，其中之一是倾向于复制旧东西 —— 那些在过去是知识前沿，但现在已经不再是的东西。</p><p>And when you do copy something, don’t copy every feature of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don’t copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old professor if you’re 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.</p><p>当我们复制某件事时，不要复制它的所有特性。如果我们复制某些部分的话，会看起来很荒谬。例如，我们 18 岁时不能复制一位 50 岁杰出教授的举止，或者几百年前文艺复兴时期诗歌的习语。</p><p>Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.</p><p>我们所崇拜事物的一些特性是「尽管他们存在缺陷但依然取得成功的」。但事实上，最容易模仿的特性最有可能是缺陷。</p><p>This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn’t; being talented is merely how they get away with it.</p><p>对于行为尤其如此。一些有才华的人是混蛋，这有时使得无经验的人认为做混蛋是才华的一部分，并不是，才华只是他们得以逃脱的方式。</p><p>One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it’s probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.</p><p>最有力的复制类型之一是从一个领域复制到另一个领域。历史上充满了这种类型的偶然发现，所以我们值得有意地去学习其他类型的工作，从而为这类偶然性提供帮助。我们可以从毫不相干的领域中获取想法，如果我们能够让它们成为灵感来源的话。</p><p>Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what’s needed when it’s missing.</p><p>负面的例子可能和积极的例子一样启发人。事实上，**我们有时可以从做得糟糕的事情中学到比从做得好的事情中更多的东西，**有时只有当它缺失时，才能清楚地看出完满需要什么。</p><p>If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it’s usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence. [26]</p><p>**如果我们所在领域的许多最好的人都集中在一个地方，那去那里待一段时间通常是个好主意。**这会增加我们的斗志，同时，通过向我们展示这些优秀的人都是人，增加我们的自信心。[26]</p><p>If you’re earnest you’ll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who’s genuinely interested. If they’re really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist’s interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies.</p><p>如果我们是真诚的，可能会受到比自己期望的更热烈的欢迎。大多数在某件事上非常出色的人都很乐意和任何真正有兴趣的人谈论它 —— 如果他们真的很擅长自己的工作，那么他们可能对它存在一种类似业余爱好者般的心理，业余爱好者总是想谈论他们的爱好。</p><p>It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there’s a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can’t say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.</p><p>然而，找到那些真正优秀的人可能需要一些努力。取得杰出成就会带来巨大的威望，以至于在一些地方，特别是大学，大家都有一个礼貌的假设，那就是每个人都在从事它。而这并非事实，人们不能公开说明这点，但在大学内部，不同部门所做的工作的质量差距巨大 —— 一些部门有人做出了伟大的工作，其他的在过去有过，其他的从来没有过。</p><p>Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can’t be done alone, and even if you’re working on one that can be, it’s good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.</p><p>**寻找最能够共事的人。**很多项目是无法独自完成的，即使我们正在从事可以独自完成的项目，也好有其他人来鼓励自己，和我们交流想法。</p><p>Colleagues don’t just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.</p><p>然而，同事不仅会影响我们的工作，他们也会影响我们本身。所以，<strong>与我们想成为的人一起工作，因为我们将会变得像他们。</strong></p><p>Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It’s better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it’s not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one’s colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.</p><p>在同事方面，质量比数量更重要 —— 拥有一两个优秀的同事比拥有一个楼的还算不错的同事更好。实际上，不仅是更好，而且是必需的，从历史来看，在集群中取得杰出成就的案例表明，同事通常决定了我们是否能取得伟大成就。</p><p>How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you’re unsure, you probably don’t. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here’s an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights. They can see and do things that you can’t. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you’re probably over the threshold.</p><p>我们如何知道自己有足够好的同事呢？根据我的经验，当我们有的时候，你就知道了 —— 这意味着，如果我们不确定，那可能没有。可能有更具体的答案，但这里是一个尝试：**足够好的同事会提供令人惊讶的见解，他们能看到并做我们不能做的事。**所以，如果我们有一小撮足够好的同事，让我们在这个意义上保持警觉，他们可能就已经越过了「不错」的阈值。</p><p>Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you’ll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don’t have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects. [27]</p><p>我们大多数人都可以从与同事的合作中获益，但一些项目需要更大规模的人，并不是每个人都适合发起这样的项目。如果我们想参与这样的项目，将必须成为一个管理者，好的管理需要才能和兴趣，这和其他任何类型的工作一样，如果我们没有它们，就没有妥协的方案：我们必须强迫自己学习管理并将其作为第二技能，或者避免参与这样的项目。[27]</p><p>Husband your morale. It’s the basis of everything when you’re working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.</p><p>**珍惜自己的士气 —— 当我们从事雄心勃勃的项目时，这是一切的基础。**我们必须像呵护生命一样来培养和保护它。</p><p>Morale starts with your view of life. You’re more likely to do great work if you’re an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.</p><p>士气从我们的人生观开始。如果我们是一个乐观主义者，则更有可能取得伟大成就，我们需要把自己看作是幸运的，而不是受害者。</p><p>Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that’s pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it’s a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history.</p><p>事实上，工作可以在某种程度上保护我们免受自己的问题的影响。如果我们选择的工作是纯洁的，那么其本身就会成为我们从日常生活的困难中寻求庇护的地方，这种逃避是非常有生产力的，一些历史上最伟大的思想家都利用过这种行为。</p><p>Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you’re not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you’re stuck, just so you start to get something done.</p><p>士气通过工作复合增长：高昂的士气帮助我们做好工作，这又增加了我们的士气，帮助我们做得更好。但这个周期也在反方向奏效：如果我们没有做好工作，那可能会让自己士气低落，使得做事更难。由于这个周期在正确的方向运行如此重要，当我们陷入困境时，切换到更简单的工作可能是个好主意，只要我们一直做事就好。</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.</p><p>雄心勃勃的人最大的错误之一就是让挫折一次性毁掉他们的士气，就像气球爆炸一样。我们可以通过明确挫折是我们过程的一部分来预防这一点，解决难题总是涉及到走回头路。</p><p>Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” isn’t quite right. It should be: If at first you don’t succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.</p><p>**取得杰出成就是一种深度优先搜索，其根节点是我们想成功的欲望。**所以，「如果一开始没有成功，再试一次」这句话并不完全正确，它应该是「如果一开始没有成功，要么再试一次，要么退回去，然后再试一次」。</p><p>“Never give up” is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it’s the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.</p><p>「永不放弃」也不完全正确，显然，有时候选择退出是正确的选择。更准确的说法应该是：永远不要让挫折让我们慌乱地走比自己需要的更多的回头路 —— 推论：永远不要放弃根节点。</p><p>It’s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it’s a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you’re running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.</p><p>工作如果令人痛苦挣扎，不一定是坏的迹象，就像在跑步时呼吸困难不一定是坏的迹象一样，这取决于我们跑得多快。所以学会区分好的痛苦和坏的痛苦 —— 好的痛苦是努力的标志，坏的痛苦是损害的标志。</p><p>An audience is a critical component of morale. If you’re a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn’t need to be big. The value of an audience doesn’t grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you’re famous, but good news if you’re just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you’re doing, that’s enough.</p><p>**「观众」是士气的关键组成部分。**学者的观众可能是他们的同行，在艺术领域，可能是传统意义上的观众 —— 无论哪种方式，观众的数量不需要很大，观众的价值并不像其大小那样成线性增长。这对于那些著名的人来说是个坏消息，但对于刚刚起步的人来说是个好消息，因为这意味着一小组专注的观众足以支持我们，如果有少数人真正喜欢我们在做的事，那就够了。</p><p>To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it’s so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct. [28]</p><p>尽可能避免让中间人介入我们和自己的观众之间。在某些类型的工作中，这种情况不可避免，但我们有极大的自由度摆脱这种情况，因此，如果能让我们直接面对自己的观众，那我们最好转而从事类似的工作。[28]</p><p>The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You’ll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you’d expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there’s someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.</p><p>我们花时间在一起的人也会对我们的士气产生很大影响。我们会发现有些人增加了自己的能量，而有些人减少了我们的能量，而一个人对你产生的影响并不总是你期望的。寻找那些能增加我们能量的人，避开那些减少我们能量的人 —— 当然，如果有人需要我们照顾，那就优先考虑。</p><p>Don’t marry someone who doesn’t understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you’re ambitious, you need to work; it’s almost like a medical condition; so someone who won’t let you work either doesn’t understand you, or does and doesn’t care.</p><p>不要与一个不明白我们需要工作，或者与我们的工作竞争注意力的人结婚。如果我们有雄心壮志，我们需要工作，这无须多言，所以，如果一个人不让我们工作，要么就是不理解我们，要么就是理解但不在乎。</p><p>Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it’s important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they’re good for thinking. [29]</p><p>最后，**士气其实也是物理的，我们用身体思考，所以照顾好它很重要。**这意味着定期运动、饮食以及保持良好睡眠，避免使用危险类型的药物。跑步和步行是特别好的锻炼方式，因为它们有利于思考。[29]</p><p>People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they’re happier than they’d be if they didn’t. In fact, if you’re smart and ambitious, it’s dangerous not to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don’t achieve much tend to become bitter.</p><p>取得杰出成就的人并不一定比其他人更快乐，但他们比不成功时更快乐。实际上，如果我们聪明而有雄心，不工作是危险的，那些聪明而有雄心，但没有成就很多的人往往会变得很痛苦。</p><p>It’s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.</p><p><strong>想要给别人留下印象是可以的，但要选择正确的人，我们所尊重的人的观点是信号；名声，也就是我们可能尊重或可能不尊重的更广泛群体的观点，只是噪音。</strong></p><p>The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you’ll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.</p><p>一种工作的声望最好的情况下是一个落后的指标，有时则是完全错误的标志。如果我们把任何事情做得足够好，我们就会使它有声望。所以，面对一种工作，我们的问题不应该是它有多大的声望，而是它可以被做到多好。</p><p>Competition can be an effective motivator, but don’t let it choose the problem for you; don’t let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don’t let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.</p><p>竞争可以是一个有效的动力，但不要让它指导我们选择问题，不要仅仅因为别人在追求某件事就让自己被扯进去。事实上，不要让竞争者指导我们做任何比较具体的事，比如更加努力工作。</p><p>Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what’s worth paying attention to.</p><p><strong>好奇心是最好的指导者，好奇心永远不会撒谎，它比我们自己更了解什么值得关注。</strong></p><p>Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on “curiosity.”</p><p>注意这个词出现的频率。<strong>如果我们问一个预言家取得杰出成就的秘密，预言家用一个词回答，我赌就是「好奇心」。</strong></p><p>That doesn’t translate directly to advice. It’s not enough just to be curious, and you can’t command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.</p><p>这并不能直接被解释为建议。仅仅是好奇是不够的，我们也不能左右好奇，但是我们可以培养它，让它驱动我们。</p><p>Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.</p><p>好奇心是做伟大工作的所有四个步骤的关键：它会为我们选择领域，带我们到达领域边界，让我们注意到其中的空白，并驱使我们去探索它们 —— 整个过程都在与好奇心共舞。</p><p>Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you’re already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.</p><p>信不信由你，我试图让这篇论文尽可能地短。但是它的长度至少意味着它起到了一个过滤器的作用 —— 如果你看到了这里，你一定对做伟大的工作感兴趣。如果是这样，你已经比你可能意识到的要进一步了，因为愿意去想的人的集合是很小的。</p><p>The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can’t do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?</p><p>取得伟大成就的因素在字面上，数学上是因素，它们是：**能力、兴趣、努力和运气。**运气是我们无法左右的，所以可以忽略它；并且，如果确实想要取得伟大成就，我们可以假设每个人都很努力；<strong>所以问题归结为能力和兴趣 —— 我们能否找到一种工作，将自己的能力和兴趣结合起来，让新想法迸发？</strong></p><p>Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you’re most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It’s just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying.</p><p>我们有乐观的理由。有很多不同的方式来取得伟大成就，与此同时，还有更多的方式还未被发现。在所有这些不同类型的工作中，我们最适合的那一种可能是非常接近的匹配，可能是一个滑稽的接近的匹配 —— 这其中只有一个问题，我们要找到它，以及我们的能力和兴趣能带自己走多远 —— 我们只能通过尝试来回答这个问题。</p><p>Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you’d fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that’s what’s going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.</p><p>可以尝试取得伟大成就的人比实际做到的人多得多，但阻止他们的是一种由谦逊和恐惧组成的混合物，例如，「试图成为牛顿或莎士比亚似乎有点狂妄，这看起来也很难」，「如果试了这样的事情，一定会失败」，「经过推算，这样的概率很小，不做是明智的」等等。很少有人有意识地决定不去尝试取得伟大成就，但这就是潜意识里正在发生的事 —— 他们回避这个问题。</p><p>So I’m going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn’t have done it to a general audience. But we already know you’re interested.</p><p>现在我要与你玩个游戏了。你想取得伟大的成就，还是不想呢？现在你必须有意识地下决定 —— 对不起，对此我感到抱歉，我一般不会对读者这么做，但看到这里，我已经知道你感兴趣了。</p><p>Don’t worry about being presumptuous. You don’t have to tell anyone. And if it’s too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you’ll be lucky if it’s the worst problem you have.</p><p>不要担心过于自大，你不需要讲这个决定告诉任何人。如果太难，失败了，那又怎样呢？很多人需要解决这更糟糕的问题 —— 实际上，如果这是你最糟糕的问题，那么你真的非常幸运。</p><p>Yes, you’ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you’re working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you’re on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers’.</p><p>是的，我们必须努力工作。但再次，很多人必须努力工作。并且，如果我们在做自己觉得非常有趣的事情，我们必然会在正确的道路上，工作可能会感觉比我们很多同伴的轻松。</p><p>The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?</p><p><strong>发现正在等待被发现，为什么不是由我们自己呢？</strong></p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] I don’t think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people’s ideas of what’s possible. But there’s no threshold for importance. It’s a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I’d rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they’re important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.</p><p>[1] 我不认为我们可以给杰出成就一个精确的定义。取得杰出成就意味着做了某件很重要事情，做得很好，以至于扩大了人们对可能性的认识，但是，对于重要性并没有一个阈值，这是一个程度的问题，而且往往很难在当时进行判断。所以，我宁愿让人们专注于发展他们的兴趣，而不是担心它们是否重要 —— 只要试图做一些令人惊奇的事情，子孙后代会判断你是否成功。</p><p>[2] A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. “Did you ever notice…?” New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people’s reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!</p><p>[2] 很多的单口喜剧都是基于在日常生活中发现的不寻常现象。「你有没有注意到…？」新的想法来自于关于非琐碎事情的这类观察，这可能有助于解释为什么人们对一个新想法的反应往往是笑：哈！</p><p>[3] That second qualifier is critical. If you’re excited about something most authorities discount, but you can’t give a more precise explanation than “they don’t get it,” then you’re starting to drift into the territory of cranks.</p><p>[3] 「有足够的专业知识来精确地说出他们都忽视了什么」这个限定是关键。如果我们对大部分权威都不认可的事情感到兴奋，但不能给出比「他们不懂」更精确的解释，那么我们自己就开始向怪人那一端发展了。</p><p>[4] Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You’ll often have to coevolve with the problem. That’s why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It’s the cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you.</p><p>[4] 找到一些事情来做并不仅仅是在当前版本和已知问题之间找到匹配的问题，我们往往必须要与问题共同发展，这就是为什么有时找出该做什么事会很困难。我们所能搜索的空间是巨大的，它是所有可能的工作类型（已知的和尚未发现的）和所有可能的未来版本的笛卡尔乘积。</p><p>There’s no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have been collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.</p><p>我们没有办法搜索整个空间，所以必须依赖启发式方法在空间中生成有希望的路径，并希望最佳匹配会聚集在一起 —— 但是，它们并不总是会聚集在一起 —— 不同类型的工作被聚集在一起，多半是由于历史的偶然性，而非它们的内在相似性。</p><p>[5] There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they’re more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place.</p><p>[5] 好奇的人更有可能取得杰出成就有很多原因，但其中的一个微妙原因是，通过撒了一个宽广的网，他们更有可能在一开始就找到正确的事情来做。</p><p>[6] It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but it’s not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.</p><p>[6] 如果我们感觉受众不如自己精明，我们可能会对他们居高临下，那么为他们制作出的东西可能也是糟糕的。如果我们抱着藐视一切的态度做产品，可以赚很多钱，但这不是通往杰出成就的路 —— 不过使用这种手段的人可能不会在意。</p><p>[7] This idea I learned from Hardy’s A Mathematician’s Apology, which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.</p><p>[7] 这个想法我从哈代的《一个数学家的辩白》中学到的，我推荐任何有抱负，要取得伟大成就的人去阅读读，无论是在什么领域。</p><p>[8] Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.</p><p>[8] 就像我们高估了我们在一天内可以做什么，低估了我们在几年内可以做什么，我们高估了拖延一天造成的损害，低估了拖延几年造成的损害。</p><p>[9] You can’t usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.</p><p>[9] 我们通常不能完全按照自己的意愿去做事，特别是在早期。有两个选择：做接近我们想做的工作并希望二者越来越接近，或者做完全不同的事情并在业余时间做自己的项目。两者都可行，但两者都有缺点：在第一种方法中，我们的工作默认被妥协了，在第二种我们必须努力找到时间去做。</p><p>[10] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.</p><p>[10] 如果我们的生活安排得当，它会自动提供「专注 - 放松」的周期。完美的设置是我们在这个循环中工作，并且拥有可以步行往返的办公室。</p><p>[11] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don’t try to be anything except the best.</p><p>[11] 也许有一些非常超凡的人，他们可以取得杰出成就，而不需要有意识地去尝试。如果我们想拓展这个规则以取得同样的成功，它会变成：除了做最好的，别尝试做其他任何事情。</p><p>[12] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it’s possible to be affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid unintentional affectation.</p><p>[12] 在诸如表演之类的工作中，目标是展现一个假的人格，这就更复杂了。但是即使在这种情况下，也有可能被矫饰影响 —— 也许在这样的领域中的规则应该是避免无意的矫饰。</p><p>[13] It’s safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they’re also unfalsifiable. For example, it’s safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a “should” in it isn’t really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there’s no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can’t be any facts you’d need to ignore in order to preserve it.</p><p>[13] 如果我们有一个原则，如何判断它是否可以被视为是无可质疑的？只有在它是无法证伪的情况下才是安全的。例如，每个人都应该在法律面前平等，这是安全的原则，因为一个带有「应该」的句子实际上并不是关于世界观的陈述，因此很难被证明是错误的。如果我们不需要掩盖任何事实以维护它，那就没有证据可以证伪我们的某个原则。</p><p>[14] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.</p><p>[14] 矫饰比智力不诚实更容易治愈。矫饰往往是年轻人的缺点，随着时间的推移会消失，而智力不诚实更像是一个性格上的缺点。</p><p>[15] Obviously you don’t have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you’ll probably have been working fairly recently.</p><p>[15] 显然，我们不必在有想法的那一刻就投入这项工作，但我们需要工作。</p><p>[16] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I’m skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.</p><p>[16] 有些人说精神活性药物有类似的效果。我持怀疑态度，但也对它们的影响几乎一无所知。</p><p>[17] For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)&#x2F;m^n of your attention, for some m &gt; 1. You couldn’t allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.</p><p>[17] 例如，我们可能会给第 n 个最重要的主题 (m-1)&#x2F;m^n 的注意力，m &gt; 1。当然，我们不能那么精确地分配自己的注意力，但这至少给出了一个合理分配的想法。</p><p>[18] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.</p><p>[18] 定义一个宗教的原则必须是错误的。否则，任何人都可能采用它们，那么就没有什么可以区分宗教信徒和其他人的了。</p><p>[19] It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you’re now in a position to do something about some of them.</p><p>[19] 试着写下我们过去好奇的问题的列表可能是一个好的练习。我们可能会发现自己现在有能力去解决其中的一些问题。</p><p>[20] The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they’re generally stupider.<br>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>Are full of passionate intensity.</p><p>[20] 原创性和不确定性之间的联系导致了一种奇特的现象：因为有传统思维的人比独立思维的人更确定，这往往给他们在争论中占上风，即使他们通常更愚蠢。最好的人都缺乏信念，而最差的人充满了顽固气息。</p><p>[21] Derived from Linus Pauling’s “If you want to have good ideas, you must have many ideas.”</p><p>[21] 来自 Linus Pauling 的「如果你想有好主意，你必须有很多主意。」</p><p>[22] Attacking a project as a “toy” is similar to attacking a statement as “inappropriate.” It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick.</p><p>[22] 称一个项目为「玩具」类似于称一个声明为「不适当」，这意味着没有更实质的批评可以给出。</p><p>[23] One way to tell whether you’re wasting time is to ask if you’re producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don’t.</p><p>[23] 判断我们是否在浪费时间的一个方法是问自己是否在生产还是在消费。写电脑游戏可能比玩它们浪费时间的可能性要小，而玩我们可以创造东西的游戏可能比玩不能创造东西的游戏浪费时间的可能性要小。</p><p>[24] Another related advantage is that if you haven’t said anything publicly yet, you won’t be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.</p><p>[24] 另一个相关的优点是，如果我们还没有公开地说过什么，就不会偏向于相信支持我们之前的结论的证据。以足够的中立态度，我们可以在这方面实现永恒青春，但很少有人能做到。对大多数人来说，以前公开过的意见有一种类似于意识形态的效果，只是在数量上为 1。</p><p>[25] In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I.

As of this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate, but that could change.</p><p>[26] 我在这里故意模糊了什么是地方的定义。截至写这篇文章，身处同一物理地点具有难以复制的优势，但这可能会改变。</p><p>[27] This is false when the work the other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it’s false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.</p><p>[27] 当其他人必须做的工作非常受限时，这是错误的，例如 SETI@home 或比特币。通过定义类似的受限协议，让节点有更大的行动自由，可能会使错误扩大。</p><p>[28] Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good idea.</p><p>[28] 推论：构建能让人们绕过中介并直接与受众接触的东西可能是个好主意。</p><p>[29] It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it.</p><p>[29] 一直走或跑同样的路线可能有所帮助，因为这给思考留出更多注意力。我有这种感觉，也有一些历史证据支持。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="GENERAL-AND-SURPRISING"><a href="#GENERAL-AND-SURPRISING" class="headerlink" title="GENERAL AND SURPRISING"></a>GENERAL AND SURPRISING</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/sun.html">https://paulgraham.com/sun.html</a></p><h3 id="一、最具价值的见解"><a href="#一、最具价值的见解" class="headerlink" title="一、最具价值的见解"></a>一、最具价值的见解</h3><p>The most valuable insights are both general and surprising. F &#x3D; ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable. </p><p>最有价值的见解兼具普遍性和惊喜感。例如 F&#x3D;ma（牛顿第二运动定律）。但兼具普遍性和惊喜感是很难实现的，这类见解所在的领域往往已被挖掘殆尽，原因恰恰在于它们极具价值。</p><p>Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. platitudes). </p><p>通常情况下，鱼和熊掌不可兼得：要么有惊喜感却缺乏普遍性（比如八卦），要么有普遍性却毫无惊喜（比如陈词滥调）。</p><p>Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable insights. You get those from small additions of whichever quality was missing. The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that’s more than just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about the world. But another less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them. Because these start out so general, you only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful insight. </p><p>真正有趣的是那些中等价值的见解。要获得这类见解，只需在缺失的特质上稍作补充。更常见的情况是补充少量普遍性：一条八卦之所以不只是八卦，是因为它能让人了解到关于世界的有趣之事。但另一种不太常见的方式是，聚焦于最具普遍性的观点，看看能否就它们说出些新东西。由于这些观点本身已经极具普遍性，因此只需一点新颖性的补充，就能产生有独到之处的见解。</p><h3 id="二、微小创意也能够带来巨大的不同"><a href="#二、微小创意也能够带来巨大的不同" class="headerlink" title="二、微小创意也能够带来巨大的不同"></a>二、微小创意也能够带来巨大的不同</h3><p>A small delta of novelty is all you’ll be able to get most of the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes you’ll find you’ve merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist. But don’t be discouraged. Remember the huge multiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of something even a little new. </p><p>大多数时候，你能获得的只是少量的新颖性。这意味着如果你选择这条路径，你的观点看起来会和已有的观点十分相似。有时你会发现，自己只是重新发现了一个早已存在的观点。但不必气馁。记住，当你确实想到哪怕一点点新东西时，随之而来的乘法效应是巨大的。</p><p>Corollary: the more general the ideas you’re talking about, the less you should worry about repeating yourself. If you write enough, it’s inevitable you will. Your brain is much the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit it. I feel slightly bad when I find I’ve said something close to what I’ve said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself. But rationally one shouldn’t. You won’t say something exactly the same way the second time, and that variation increases the chance you’ll get that tiny but critical delta of novelty. </p><p>推论：你谈论的观点越具普遍性，就越不必担心重复自己。如果你写得足够多，重复是不可避免的。你的大脑年复一年变化不大，冲击它的刺激也大致相同。当我发现自己说的话和以前说过的很接近时，会略感不适，仿佛在抄袭自己。但理性而言，不必如此。你第二次不会用完全相同的方式表达，而这种差异会增加你获得那微小却关键的新颖性增量的机会。</p><h3 id="三、持续探索的勇气"><a href="#三、持续探索的勇气" class="headerlink" title="三、持续探索的勇气"></a>三、持续探索的勇气</h3><p>And of course, ideas beget ideas. (That sounds familiar.) An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one with more. But only if you keep going. So it’s doubly important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who say there’s not much new about something you’ve discovered. “Not much new” is a real achievement when you’re talking about the most general ideas. </p><p>当然，观点会催生新观点。（这话听着耳熟。）一个带有少量新颖性的观点可能会引出更具新颖性的观点，但前提是你要坚持下去。因此，当有人说你发现的东西没什么新意时，千万不要气馁，这一点尤为重要。当你谈论的是最具普遍性的观点时，“没太多新意” 其实是一项实实在在的成就。</p><p>It’s not true that there’s nothing new under the sun. There are some domains where there’s almost nothing new. But there’s a big difference between nothing and almost nothing, when it’s multiplied by the area under the sun.</p><p>“日光之下并无新事” 这句话并不正确。有些领域几乎没有新东西，但 “完全没有新东西” 和 “几乎没有新东西” 之间存在巨大差异，尤其是当它乘以 “日光之下的广阔领域” 时。</p>]]></content>

    <title>何时去追寻你所热爱</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="WHEN-TO-DO-WHAT-YOU-LOVE"><a href="#WHEN-TO-DO-WHAT-YOU-LOVE" class="headerlink" title="WHEN TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE"></a>WHEN TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/when.html">https://paulgraham.com/when.html</a></p><h3 id="一、关于“追随热情”的争论"><a href="#一、关于“追随热情”的争论" class="headerlink" title="一、关于“追随热情”的争论"></a>一、关于“追随热情”的争论</h3><p>There’s some debate about whether it’s a good idea to “follow your passion.” In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn’t, but the border between should and shouldn’t is very complicated. The only way to give a general answer is to trace it. </p><p>关于 “追随激情” 是否是个好主意，存在一些争议。事实上，这个问题无法用简单的 “是” 或 “否” 来回答。有时应该，有时不应该，但 “应该” 与 “不应该” 之间的界限非常复杂。给出一个一般性答案的唯一方法，是追溯其背后的逻辑。</p><p>When people talk about this question, there’s always an implicit “instead of.” All other things being equal, why wouldn’t you work on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies that all other things aren’t equal, and that you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best. </p><p>人们讨论这个问题时，总会隐含一个 “取而代之” 的前提。在其他条件相同的情况下，为什么不做自己最感兴趣的事呢？因此，即便提出这个问题，也意味着其他条件并不相同 —— 你必须在 “做最感兴趣的事” 和 “其他事”（比如薪资最高的事）之间做出选择。</p><p>And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can’t usually afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for doing what they want, not what you want. But there’s an obvious exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you love football, and you’re good enough at it, you can get paid a lot to play it. </p><p>的确，若你的主要目标是赚钱，通常就没法只顾着做最感兴趣的事。人们付钱给你，是为了让你做他们想让你做的事，而非你自己想做的事。但有个明显的例外：当你和他们的需求一致时。比如，如果你热爱足球，且足够擅长，就能靠踢球赚很多钱。</p><p>Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you shouldn’t try though. It depends how much ability you have and how hard you’re willing to work. </p><p>当然，在足球这类领域，成功的概率对你不利，因为太多人也喜欢踢球。但这并非说你不该尝试 —— 这取决于你的能力有多强，以及你愿意付出多少努力。</p><p>The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like something that pays well and that few other people like. For example, it’s clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company. He didn’t just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed, but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it. </p><p>当你的喜好比较特别时，成功的概率会更高：比如你喜欢的事既能赚钱，又没多少人感兴趣。显然，比尔・盖茨是真的热爱经营软件公司。他不只是热爱编程（很多人都热爱编程），而是热爱为客户写软件。这确实是一种非常特别的喜好，但如果你有这种喜好，沉浸其中就能赚很多钱。</p><p>There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can’t help noticing when something is mispriced, and can’t help doing something about it. It’s like a puzzle for them. [1] </p><p>甚至有一些人，对赚钱有着真正的智力层面的兴趣。这和单纯的贪婪不同。他们总会不由自主地发现定价不合理的东西，也总会忍不住去做点什么。对他们来说，这就像一道谜题。[1]</p><h3 id="二、目标与兴趣的平衡"><a href="#二、目标与兴趣的平衡" class="headerlink" title="二、目标与兴趣的平衡"></a>二、目标与兴趣的平衡</h3><p>In fact there’s an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really huge amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars — it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent way to discover startup ideas. </p><p>事实上，这里有一个极端案例，它的影响之大，足以颠覆前面所有的建议。如果你想赚一大笔钱 —— 数亿甚至数十亿美元 —— 那么，做自己最感兴趣的事其实非常有用。原因并非做这些事能带来额外的动力，而是赚大钱的方式往往是创办初创公司，而做自己感兴趣的事，是发现初创公司创意的绝佳途径。</p><p>Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas tend to be such outliers that you’d overlook them if you were consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you’re young and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to be built. </p><p>即便不是大多数，也有很多顶尖的初创公司，最初都是创始人出于乐趣而做的项目。苹果、谷歌、脸书都是如此。为什么这种模式如此常见？因为最棒的创意往往太出格，如果你刻意追求赚钱，很可能会忽略它们。而如果你年轻且擅长技术，你对 “做什么事有趣” 的直觉，往往和 “该创造什么” 高度契合。</p><p>So there’s something like a midwit peak for making money. If you don’t need to make much, you can work on whatever you’re most interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can’t usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you’re young and good at technology, working on what you’re most interested in becomes a good idea again. </p><p>所以，在赚钱这件事上，存在一种 “中等智慧峰值”：如果你不需要赚太多钱，就能做自己最感兴趣的事；如果你想变得小康，通常就不能只顾兴趣；但如果你想变得超级富有，且年轻又擅长技术，那么做自己最感兴趣的事又会成为一个好主意。</p><h3 id="三、何时做出抉择"><a href="#三、何时做出抉择" class="headerlink" title="三、何时做出抉择"></a>三、何时做出抉择</h3><p>What if you’re not sure what you want? What if you’re attracted to the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break ties? </p><p>如果你不确定自己想要什么呢？如果你既被赚钱的想法吸引，又对某些工作更感兴趣，但两者都没有绝对优势，该如何抉择？</p><p>The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent. When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and making money, it’s never because you have complete knowledge of yourself and of the types of work you’re choosing between, and the options are perfectly balanced. When you can’t decide which path to take, it’s almost always due to ignorance. In fact you’re usually suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don’t know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well you could do them. [2] </p><p>关键在于，这种 “难以抉择” 往往只是表面现象。当你在 “追随兴趣” 和 “赚钱” 之间犹豫时，绝非因为你完全了解自己、了解可选的工作，且选项完美平衡。你无法决定，几乎总是因为信息不足 —— 你不知道什么能让自己快乐，不知道各种工作的真实情况，也不知道自己能把这些工作做得多好。[2]</p><p>In a way this ignorance is excusable. It’s often hard to predict these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you’re ambitious you’re told you should go to college, and this is good advice so far as it goes, but that’s where it usually ends. No one tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can be. </p><p>在某种程度上，这种信息不足是可以理解的。预测这些事往往很难，而且没人告诉你需要去弄清楚这些。如果你有野心，别人会告诉你应该上大学，这在某种程度上是个好建议，但通常也就到此为止了。没人告诉你该如何确定自己要做什么，也没人告诉你这件事有多难。</p><p>What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you’re interested in. That will get you more information about how interested you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they offer for ambition. </p><p>面对不确定性该怎么办？去获取更多确定性。最好的方法可能就是尝试做自己感兴趣的事。这会让你更清楚自己对这件事的兴趣有多深、自己有多擅长，以及这件事能给你多大的发展空间。</p><p>Don’t wait. Don’t wait till the end of college to figure out what to work on. Don’t even wait for internships during college. You don’t necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve, the sooner you start, the better. </p><p>别等。别等到大学毕业才确定自己要做什么，甚至别等到大学期间的实习。你不一定非要找到一份做某件事的工作才能去做它 —— 通常你自己就能以某种形式开始。既然确定自己要做什么可能需要好几年，那么越早开始越好。</p><h3 id="四、时势造英雄"><a href="#四、时势造英雄" class="headerlink" title="四、时势造英雄"></a>四、时势造英雄</h3><p>One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at who your colleagues will be. You’ll become like whoever you work with. Do you want to become like these people? </p><p>判断不同工作的一个有用技巧，是看看你未来的同事会是什么样的人。你会变得和他们越来越像。你想变成他们那样吗？</p><p>Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well it pays, you’ll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you’re genuinely interested in, you’ll be surrounded mostly by other people who are genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring. [3] </p><p>事实上，不同工作在 “人的特质” 上的差异，会因 “每个人都在做类似选择” 而被放大。如果你选一份工作主要是因为薪水高，身边就会围绕着同样为钱而来的人，这会让这份工作比表面看起来更让人身心俱疲。而如果你选择自己真正感兴趣的工作，身边大多会是同样感兴趣的人，这会让工作额外鼓舞人心。[3]</p><p>The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do, the more important it is to choose options that give you more options in the future. I call this “staying upwind.” If you’re unsure whether to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch later from math to economics than from economics to math. </p><p>面对不确定性时，另一件要做的事是做 “抗不确定性” 的选择。你越不确定该做什么，就越要选那些能给未来留更多选项的事。我称之为 “保持在上风处”。比如，如果你不确定该选数学还是经济学专业，就选数学 —— 数学相对于经济学处于 “上风”，因为日后从数学转经济学比从经济学转数学更容易。</p><p>There’s one case, though, where it’s easy to say whether you should work on what interests you the most: if you want to do great work. This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is a necessary one. </p><p>不过，有一种情况，“是否该做自己最感兴趣的事” 的答案很明确：如果你想做出伟大的成就。这不是做出伟大成就的充分条件，但却是必要条件。</p><p>There’s a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to “follow your passion,” and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who’s famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you that you have to work on what you’re most interested in. And this is in fact true. </p><p>关于 “是否该追随激情” 的建议，存在很强的选择性偏差，这就是原因所在。大多数这类建议来自那些非常成功的人，如果你问一个极其成功的人如何取得成就，大多数人会告诉你，必须做自己最感兴趣的事。而这其实是事实。</p><p>That doesn’t mean it’s the right advice for everyone. Not everyone can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort of ambitious curiosity, and you can’t manufacture that.     </p><p>但这并不意味着这对每个人都是正确的建议。不是每个人都能或都想做出伟大的成就。但如果你想，那么 “是否该做自己最感兴趣的事” 这个复杂的问题就会变得简单 —— 答案是 “是”。伟大成就的根源，是一种充满野心的好奇心，而这种好奇心是无法刻意制造的。</p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] These examples show why it’s a mistake to assume that economic inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness. It’s obvious that different people have different interests, and that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality is the natural outcome. </p><p>[1] 这些例子说明，认为 “经济不平等一定是某种缺陷或不公的证据” 是错误的。显然，不同的人有不同的兴趣，有些兴趣能带来多得多的钱，那么有些人比其他人富有得多，这不也是显而易见的吗？在一个有人喜欢写企业软件、有人喜欢做工作室陶艺的世界里，经济不平等是自然的结果。</p><p>[2] Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter. That’s not always due to ignorance. It’s often intrinsically difficult. I still have trouble doing it. </p><p>[2] 在不同兴趣之间难以抉择则是另一回事。这并不总是因为信息不足，往往本质上就很难。我至今也很难做到。</p><p>[3] You can’t always take people at their word on this. Since it’s more prestigious to work on things you’re interested in than to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought experiment: if their work didn’t pay well, would they take day jobs doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically lots have. But I don’t think as many investment bankers would.</p><p>[3] 在这一点上，你不能总是轻信别人的话。因为 “为兴趣工作” 比 “为钱工作” 更体面，所以那些主要为钱工作的人，往往会宣称自己对工作的兴趣比实际更深。检验这种说法的一个方法是做这样一个思想实验：如果他们的工作薪水不高，他们会做一份其他的日常工作，以便在业余时间继续做这份工作吗？很多数学家、科学家和工程师会这么做。历史上很多人都是如此。但我觉得，投资银行家里这么做的人不会太多。</p>]]></content>

    <title>好的写作</title>
    <link href="/2025/07/14/good-wrting/"/>
    <url>/2025/07/14/good-wrting/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="GOOD-WRITING"><a href="#GOOD-WRITING" class="headerlink" title="GOOD WRITING"></a>GOOD WRITING</h2><p>原文链接: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html">https://paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html</a></p><h3 id="一、听起来好-与-观点正确"><a href="#一、听起来好-与-观点正确" class="headerlink" title="一、听起来好 与 观点正确"></a>一、听起来好 与 观点正确</h3><p>There are two senses in which writing can be good: it can sound good, and the ideas can be right. It can have nice, flowing sentences, and it can draw correct conclusions about important things. It might seem as if these two kinds of good would be unrelated, like the speed of a car and the color it’s painted. And yet I don’t think they are. I think writing that sounds good is more likely to be right. </p><p>好的写作可以体现在两个方面：一是<strong>听起来好</strong>，二是<strong>思想正确</strong>。它可以拥有流畅优美的句子，也可以对重要事物得出正确的结论。乍看之下，这两种“好”似乎毫无关联，就像汽车的速度和它的颜色一样互不相干。然而，我认为它们并非如此。<strong>我认为听起来好的文字，更可能是正确的。</strong></p><p>So here we have the most exciting kind of idea: one that seems both preposterous and true. Let’s examine it. How can this possibly be true? </p><p>于是，我们遇到了最令人兴奋的那种观点：一个看似荒谬却又真实的想法。让我们仔细审视它——这怎么可能成立？</p><p>I know it’s true from writing. You can’t simultaneously optimize two unrelated things; when you push one far enough, you always end up sacrificing the other. And yet no matter how hard I push, I never find myself having to choose between the sentence that sounds best and the one that expresses an idea best. If I did, it would be frivolous to care how sentences sound. But in practice it feels the opposite of frivolous. Fixing sentences that sound bad seems to help get the ideas right. [1] </p><p>我从写作中知道这是真的。你无法同时优化两件毫无关联的事情；当你把其中一件事推到极致时，总会牺牲另一件。然而，无论我如何努力，我从未发现自己必须在“听起来最好的句子”和“表达思想最准确的句子”之间做选择。如果真是这样，纠结句子的音律就显得轻浮了。但实践中，这种感觉恰恰相反——<strong>修改听起来别扭的句子，似乎能帮助理清思想</strong>[1]</p><p>By right I mean more than just true. Getting the ideas right means developing them well — drawing the conclusions that matter most, and exploring each one to the right level of detail. So getting the ideas right is not just a matter of saying true things, but saying the right true things. </p><p>这里的“正确”不仅仅是“真实”。思想正确意味着充分发展它们——得出最重要的结论，并以恰当的细节层次展开。因此，思想正确不只是说真话，而是说出<strong>该说的真话</strong>。</p><p>How could trying to make sentences sound good help you do that? The clue to the answer is something I noticed 30 years ago when I was doing the layout for my first book. Sometimes when you’re laying out text you have bad luck. For example, you get a section that runs one line longer than the page. I don’t know what ordinary typesetters do in this situation, but what I did was rewrite the section to make it a line shorter. You’d expect such an arbitrary constraint to make the writing worse. But I found, to my surprise, that it never did. I always ended up with something I liked better. </p><p>为什么追求句子的音律能帮助做到这一点？答案的线索来自30年前我为第一本书排版时的发现。排版时偶尔会遇到厄运：比如某个章节比页面多出一行。我不知道普通排版师会怎么做，但我的解决方法是重写那段，让它缩短一行。这种武断的限制本该让文字变得更糟，但出乎意料的是，结果总是更好。</p><h3 id="二、文章的重力定律"><a href="#二、文章的重力定律" class="headerlink" title="二、文章的重力定律"></a>二、文章的重力定律</h3><p>I don’t think this was because my writing was especially careless. I think if you pointed to a random paragraph in anything written by anyone and told them to make it slightly shorter (or longer), they’d probably be able to come up with something better.</p><p>The best analogy for this phenomenon is when you shake a bin full of different objects. The shakes are arbitrary motions. Or more precisely, they’re not calculated to make any two specific objects fit more closely together. And yet repeated shaking inevitably makes the objects discover brilliantly clever ways of packing themselves. Gravity won’t let them become less tightly packed, so any change has to be a change for the better. [2] </p><p>我不认为这是因为我的写作特别粗心。我相信，如果随机指一段别人的文字并要求稍作删减（或扩充），他们很可能改得更好。</p><p>这种现象的最佳类比是摇晃装满杂物的箱子。摇晃是随机的动作，或者说，它并非为了让某两件物品更紧密贴合。然而，反复摇晃最终会让物品找到绝妙的排列方式。重力不允许它们松散，所以任何变化都只能是优化[2]。</p><p>So it is with writing. If you have to rewrite an awkward passage, you’ll never do it in a way that makes it less true. You couldn’t bear it, any more than gravity could bear things floating upward. So any change in the ideas has to be a change for the better. </p><p>写作也是如此。如果你必须重写一段拗口的文字，绝不会以牺牲真实性为代价。你无法忍受这种妥协，就像重力无法接受物体向上飘浮。因此，思想上的任何调整都只能是改进。</p><p>It’s obvious once you think about it. Writing that sounds good is more likely to be right for the same reason that a well-shaken bin is more likely to be tightly packed. But there’s something else going on as well. Sounding good isn’t just a random external force that leaves the ideas in an essay better off. It actually helps you to get them right. </p><p>细想之下，这显而易见。<strong>听起来好的文字更可能是正确的，就像摇晃充分的箱子更可能紧凑</strong>。但还有另一层原因：音律并非只是随机外力，被动地优化文章思想——它<strong>主动</strong>帮助你理清思路。</p><h3 id="三、好的文章是易读的"><a href="#三、好的文章是易读的" class="headerlink" title="三、好的文章是易读的"></a>三、好的文章是易读的</h3><p>The reason is that it makes the essay easier to read. It’s less work to read writing that flows well. How does that help the writer? Because the writer is the first reader. When I’m working on an essay, I spend far more time reading than writing. I’ll reread some parts 50 or 100 times, replaying the thoughts in them and asking myself, like someone sanding a piece of wood, does anything catch? Does anything feel wrong? And the easier the essay is to read, the easier it is to notice if something catches. </p><p>因为音律让文章更易读。流畅的文字减轻了阅读负担。这对作者有何帮助？因为<strong>作者是第一位读者</strong>。写文章时，我花在阅读上的时间远多于写作。某些段落我会重读50甚至100遍，反复咀嚼其中的思想，像打磨木头一样自问：是否有阻滞？是否有不对劲？文章越易读，越容易发现这些问题。</p><p>So yes, the two senses of good writing are connected in at least two ways. Trying to make writing sound good makes you fix mistakes unconsciously, and also helps you fix them consciously; it shakes the bin of ideas, and also makes mistakes easier to see. But now that we’ve dissolved one layer of preposterousness, I can’t resist adding another. Does sounding good do more than just help you get the ideas right? Is writing that sounds good inherently more likely to be right? Crazy as it may seem, I think that’s true too. </p><p>因此，好的写作的两个维度至少通过两种方式关联：追求音律能让你无意识地修正错误，也有助于有意识地改进；它既“摇晃思想的箱子”，又让错误更易察觉。但既然我们已经揭开了一层荒谬，我不妨再添一层：**音律的作用是否不止于辅助思想正确？听起来好的文字是否天生更可能是正确的？**尽管看似疯狂，我认为确实如此。</p><p>Obviously there’s a connection at the level of individual words. There are lots of words in English that sound like what they mean, often in wonderfully subtle ways. Glitter. Round. Scrape. Prim. Cavalcade. But the sound of good writing depends even more on the way you put words together, and there’s a connection at that level too. </p><p>显然，单个词汇层面就存在关联。英语中许多词的发音暗示其含义，且方式精妙至极。比如“glitter”（闪烁）、“round”（圆润）、“scrape”（刮擦）、“prim”（刻板）、“cavalcade”（队列）。但好文章的音律更多取决于词语组合方式，而这一层面同样存在联系。</p><h3 id="四、好的节奏产生好的文章"><a href="#四、好的节奏产生好的文章" class="headerlink" title="四、好的节奏产生好的文章"></a>四、好的节奏产生好的文章</h3><p>When writing sounds good, it’s mostly because it has good rhythm. But the rhythm of good writing is not the rhythm of music, or the meter of verse. It’s not so regular. If it were, it wouldn’t be good, because the rhythm of good writing has to match the ideas in it, and ideas have all kinds of different shapes. Sometimes they’re simple and you just state them. But other times they’re more subtle, and you need longer, more complicated sentences to tease out all the implications. </p><p>文章听起来好，主要因其节奏得当。但优秀写作的节奏并非音乐的韵律或诗歌的格律，它没那么规整。如果规整，反而不好，因为好文章的节奏必须匹配其中的思想，而思想的形态千差万别。有时它们简单直接，只需陈述；有时则微妙复杂，需要更长的句子梳理全部内涵。</p><p>An essay is a cleaned up train of thought, in the same way dialogue is cleaned up conversation, and a train of thought has a natural rhythm. So when an essay sounds good, it’s not merely because it has a pleasing rhythm, but because it has its natural one. Which means you can use getting the rhythm right as a heuristic for getting the ideas right. And not just in principle: good writers do both simultaneously as a matter of course. Often I don’t even distinguish between the two problems. I just think Ugh, this doesn’t sound right; what do I mean to say here? [3] </p><p>文章是整理过的思路轨迹，如同对白是加工过的对话，而思路自有其自然节奏。因此，文章音律好不仅因为节奏悦耳，更因为节奏<strong>自然</strong>。这意味着你可以把节奏正确作为思想正确的启发式标准。而且不仅是理论上的——优秀作者在实践中会同步解决这两个问题。我常甚至不区分它们，只是觉得“呃，这里听起来不对——我到底想说什么？”[3]</p><p>The sound of writing turns out to be more like the shape of a plane than the color of a car. If it looks good, as Kelly Johnson used to say, it will fly well. </p><p>最终，文字的音律更像飞机的气动外形，而非汽车的颜色。正如凯利·约翰逊所言：“如果它看起来对，飞起来就不会差。”</p><p>This is only true of writing that’s used to develop ideas, though. It doesn’t apply when you have ideas in some other way and then write about them afterward — for example, if you build something, or conduct an experiment, and then write a paper about it. In such cases the ideas often live more in the work than the writing, so the writing can be bad even though the ideas are good. The writing in textbooks and popular surveys can be bad for the same reason: the author isn’t developing the ideas, merely describing other people’s. It’s only when you’re writing to develop ideas that there’s such a close connection between the two senses of doing it well. </p><p>不过，这仅适用于<strong>用于发展思想的写作</strong>。如果你通过其他方式（比如建造某物或做实验）获得思想后再写成文章，音律与思想的关联就会减弱。这类情况下，思想更多存在于工作中而非文字里，因此文章可能糟糕但思想正确。教科书和科普读物的文字不佳也源于此——作者并非发展思想，只是转述他人。<strong>唯有当你通过写作探索思想时，两种“好”才会紧密相连。</strong></p><h3 id="五、内部一致与真实的重合"><a href="#五、内部一致与真实的重合" class="headerlink" title="五、内部一致与真实的重合"></a>五、内部一致与真实的重合</h3><p>Ok, many people will be thinking, this seems plausible so far, but what about liars? Is it not notoriously possible for a smooth-tongued liar to write something beautiful that’s completely false? </p><p>读到此处，许多人会想：目前为止还算合理，但骗子呢？巧舌如簧的骗子难道不能写出优美而完全虚假的文字吗？</p><p>It is, of course. But not without method acting. The way to write something beautiful and false is to begin by making yourself almost believe it. So just like someone writing something beautiful and true, you’re presenting a perfectly-formed train of thought. The difference is the point where it attaches to the world. You’re saying something that would be true if certain false premises were. If for some bizarre reason the number of jobs in a country were fixed, then immigrants really would be taking our jobs. </p><p>当然可以。但前提是<strong>方法派演技</strong>。写出美丽谎言的方法，是先让自己几乎相信它。因此，与写出美丽真理的人一样，你呈现的是一段完美成型的思路。区别在于它和现实的连接点——你描述的是一种在虚假前提下成立的真实。比如，如果某国工作岗位数量固定（尽管这荒诞），那么移民确实会“抢走我们的工作”。</p><p>So it’s not quite right to say that better sounding writing is more likely to be true. Better sounding writing is more likely to be internally consistent. If the writer is honest, internal consistency and truth converge. But while we can’t safely conclude that beautiful writing is true, it’s usually safe to conclude the converse: something that seems clumsily written will usually have gotten the ideas wrong too. </p><p>因此，“音律好的文字更可能真实”并不完全准确。更准确的说法是：<strong>音律好的文字更可能内部一致</strong>。如果作者诚实，内部一致与真实自会重合。</p><p>Indeed, the two senses of good writing are more like two ends of the same thing. The connection between them is not a rigid one; the goodness of good writing is not a rod but a rope, with multiple overlapping connections running through it. But it’s hard to move one end without moving the other. It’s hard to be right without sounding right.</p><p>虽然我们不能断言优美文字必然真实，但通常可以安全地反推：<strong>笨拙的文字往往思想也有问题</strong>。</p><p>事实上，好的写作的两个维度更像是同一事物的两端。它们的联系并非 rigid（僵硬的杆），而是 rope（柔韧的绳），内含多重交织的关联。但你很难只移动一端而不牵动另一端。<strong>很难正确而不听起来正确。</strong></p><p>Notes </p><p>[1] The closest thing to an exception is when you have to go back and insert a new point into the middle of something you’ve written. This often messes up the flow, sometimes in ways you can never quite repair. But I think the ultimate source of this problem is that ideas are tree-shaped and essays are linear. You inevitably run into difficulties when you try to cram the former into the latter. Frankly it’s surprising how much you can get away with. But even so you sometimes have to resort to an endnote. </p><p>[1] 最接近例外的情况是：当你需要在已写好的内容中插入新观点时，常会破坏行文流畅性，有时甚至无法完全修复。我认为根本原因在于思想是树状结构，而文章是线性的。将前者塞进后者时难免遇到困难。说实话，能勉强做到的程度已令人惊讶。但即便如此，有时你仍不得不借助尾注。</p><p>[2] Obviously if you shake the bin hard enough the objects in it can become less tightly packed. And similarly, if you imposed some huge external constraint on your writing, like using alternating one and two syllable words, the ideas would start to suffer. </p><p>[2] 显然，如果摇晃过于剧烈，箱内物品反而会变松散。同理，如果对写作施加某些极端限制（比如交替使用单双音节词），思想就会受损。</p><p>[3] Bizarrely enough, this happened in the writing of this very paragraph. An earlier version shared several phrases in common with the preceding paragraph, and the repetition bugged me each time I reread it. When I got annoyed enough to fix it, I discovered that the repetition reflected a problem in the underlying ideas, and I fixed both simultaneously.</p><p>[3] 诡异的是，这段文字的写作过程就印证了这一点。初稿与前一段有多个重复短语，每次重读都让我不适。当我终于忍无可忍去修改时，发现重复反映了底层思想的问题，于是同步修正了两者。</p>]]></content>
